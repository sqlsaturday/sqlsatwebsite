    <h1><a name="sponsorship">Sponsorship Plan</a></h1>
    <p>SQLSaturday Orlando will be held on the campus of Seminole State College on October 12th, 2024. This year we plan to deliver five tracks with each having five one hour presentations and a final end of day gathering for giving away prizes. Our normal attendance is in the range of 250-275, but based on other recent events we are forecasting 125-150 attendees (250+ registrations).</p>
    <h2 id="sponsorship-levels">Sponsorship Levels</h2>

The raffle tickets will have a QR code that contains the attendee info.
