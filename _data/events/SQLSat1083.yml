  <p>Many companies are placing their corporate information into data lakes in the cloud. Since storage costs are cheap, the amount of data stored in the lake can easily exceed the amount of data seen in a typical relational database. Regardless of the types of files in the data lake, there is always a need to transform the raw data files into refined data files for analytics, machine learning, and/or AI.</p>
  <h2>SQL Server Best Practices...In Practice! by Rick Lowe</h2>
  <p>An in-depth dive into SQL Server best practices: Why they exist and how best to use them to improve availability and reliability.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/sql-server-best-practicesin-practice-tickets-920134185117">Register for the precon here</a>.</p>
  <p>The intent of this session is to drill into the reasoning behind SQL Server best practices. Most of us have had experiences with releases that "worked fine in test" but led to issues in production. This session is aimed both at those who develop code as well as those who maintain the servers and are looking for more effective ways to engage with developers.</p>
