  <h2>Mastering Query Tuning by Brent Ozar</h2>
  <p>You need to speed up a SQL Server app, and you’re allowed to change the queries and indexes – but not the server hardware or settings. Good news – I’ll teach you how in a day of learning and fun. Join me, Brent Ozar, as I explain how to make your SQL Server apps go faster.</p>
  <p>We'll cover:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How SQL Server builds query plans</li>
    <li>How to choose between CTEs, temp tables, and APPLY</li>
    <li>How to tune for SELECT * and lots of rows</li>
    <li>How to write dynamic SQL that scales</li>
    <li>How to avoid pitfalls like deadlocks and bad batching</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Early bird pricing ends on April 05, 2023.</p>
