    <h2>Execution Plans in depth with Hugo Kornelis</h2><p>For troubleshooting slow queries, looking at the execution plan is a good starting point. But sometimes, just looking at the plan does not help. Sometimes you need to dig deeper.</p>
    <p>In this full-day pre-con session, you will learn everything you need to be take your understanding of execution plans to the next level. For almost every operator you can encounter in an execution plan, we will look at the inner workings, and look at properties that can affect their performance. We will also look at how operators in a plan interact with and affect each other.</p>
    <p>Aside from explaining all of the common operators, we will also touch on several operators that were introduced or modified in the newer versions of SQL Server.</p>
    <p><strong>In short:</strong> After this pre-con, you will be better prepared to look at execution plans, find the spot where it hurts, and then rewrite your query to get a faster execution plan.</p>
    <p>If you have seen some execution plans but feel you need to bring your understanding to the next level, then this pre-con is for you.</p>
