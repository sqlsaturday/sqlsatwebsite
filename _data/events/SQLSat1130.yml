    <h1><a name="sponsorship">Sponsorship Plan</a></h1>
    <p>SQL Saturday Oregon and SW Washington will be held on the campus of Clark College on November 2nd, 2025. This year we plan to deliver five tracks with each having six one hour presentations and a final end of day gathering for giving away prizes. Our normal attendance is in the range of 400 +</p>
    <p>In order to remove some of the issues with the classic “lunchtime” vendor sessions, we are going to have the Marquee presentations on the main stage.  </p>
    <p>You can <A href="/assets/event/1082/SQLSaturdayOregon2025_SponsorPlan.docx">download the sponsorship plan here</a>.
    <h2>Sponsorship Levels</h2>

    <h3>Add-On Sponsorship Options</h3>
    <p>The following add-on options are available. Must be bundled with a sponsorship above. Please contact us if you want to sign up for one of these and we can send you a single payment link.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lanyards & Badge Holders. $250 + cost of the materials (or you provide)</li>
      <li>Speaker shirts $1500). Our logo on the front, your logo on the sleeves, nicely embroidered.</li>

      <li>After Party ($500). This would run from 5-7 pm and usually includes soft drinks and appetizers, but we can customize this if you want to do more.</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>ATTENDEE INFORMATION</h3>
    <p>Unless the attendee specifically requests that their information not be shared, sponsors will receive contact information for all attendees.</p>
    <h3>TICKETS AND RAFFLES</h3>
    <p>This year we will be doing away with the ticket bucket concept.  Since the vendors will be getting full list of the attendees, all names will be eligible for the raffles.  We will still continue the practice of having each vendor come and draw each name for each prize from one big bucket.</p>
