    <h1>Additional Information</h1>
    <p>SQL Saturday Baton Rouge 2022 is produced by and for the community of SQL developers, administrators, and affiliated disciplines. Event Sponsorship does not entail oversight or selection of topics or content.</p>
    <p>All fees must be paid in advance. Payment can be made via PayPal (which can process a credit card) to <a href=mainto:sqlpassbr@gmail.com>sqlpassbr@gmail.com</a> or check. Corporate checks are preferred and should be made out to “Baton Rouge User Groups”, the name of a not-for-profit corporation that helps operate many local Baton Rouge technical user groups (including .NET, SQL, SharePoint and more) in addition to the annual SQLSaturday and SharePoint Saturday events. We can, upon request, provide an official invoice for expense purposes.</p>
    <h1>Logistics</h1>
    <p>Registration for attendees opens at 7:30am, and the building should be open by 7:00am for booth setup. Vendors and sponsors should arrive no later than 7:30am. All sponsors with booths will be provided with table and two chairs, and access to a power strip. Tables will be in the same area as registration and breakfast to make it easy for attendees to stop by your table.</p>
    <p>Please emphasize to your corporate representatives on site at the event that they should remain on site through the end of the day, so they can personally greet the entire conference attendance in the Auditorium, be photographed and present any prize(s) to raffle winners. The final raffle usually is over by 430pm.</p>
    <p>Lunch will be provided to all attendees including sponsor attendees. <b>All attendees from your corporation should register at SQLSaturday.com</b>, including <b>everyone</b> from your booth team. This is so that we can have enough food available at lunch.</p>
    <p>Information about the SQLSaturday Pre-Conference Banquet will be made available soon.</p>
    <h1>Important Deadlines and Shipping Information</h1>
    <p>Payment, materials for 600 bags, and sponsor booth materials can all be mailed to: </p>
    <address>Baton Rouge User Groups<br>
    9618 Jefferson Hwy<br>
    Suite D Box 113<br>
    Baton Rouge, LA 70809<br>
    (225) 755-9325<br></address>

    <p>Sponsor registration and payment deadline is <b>July 29, 2022</b>. In the past we have sold out of booth space a month before the event. Materials for bags <b>MUST</b> be delivered by <b>July 27, 2022</b>. Email below for local delivery if desired.</p>

    <h1>The Raffle – Your Key to Success!</h1>
    <p>The biggest challenge with community events is capturing contact information for follow ups. Few attendees will have 
    business cards and having them hand write their info often leads to a 30% or higher loss due to inability to read what 
    they wrote! We provide attendees with a set of pre-printed raffle tickets (see below) that will contain their name and
    email address; they are then able to put these tickets into the raffle box at each sponsor table to try to win a
    prize. This gives you 100% readability and 0% loss! It is also more effective than any other technique we’ve seen for
    trying to capture contact information and that includes scanning their name badge.</p>
    <p>Because we want you to be successful all our sponsorship levels include the requirement that you provide a prize of
    at least $100 in value, and that you provide a full color 8-1/2 x 11 flyers that highlights the prize(s) you are
    providing for the raffle.</p>
    <p>We provide the raffle box. We will have one table for all absentee vendors placed in the same areas with our onsite
    vendors. Raffle ticket collection will proceed through the end of the day. If someone from your team is present, we’ll
    ask them to draw the winning ticket, otherwise we’ll draw the ticket. Attendees must be present to win. If there is a
    physical prize we’ll give it to them, otherwise we’ll forward you their contact information for you to follow up with
    (for license keys, etc.)</p>
    <p>After the event we will mail you all the raffle tickets from your box. There may be duplicates; depending on how
    exciting your prize is attendees may contribute more than one ticket to your box – but that’s a good thing, they are
    willing to provide you their contact information in return for the chance to win.</p>
