  <p>You're managing databases that live in AWS, Azure, and Google, and you're getting a lot of questions about slow performance and crazy costs. Your users want everything faster and cheaper, and you're not finding good answers.</p>
  <p>Join me, Brent Ozar, for a day of real-time demos, honest war stories, and practical fixes. I'll tackle an Azure SQL DB Managed Instance in the morning, and then an Amazon RDS SQL Server in the afternoon. I'll show how I use the First Responder Kit to assess the bottleneck, mitigate as much as I can with index and query tuning, and then write up a business case for management for better future budgeting.</p> 
  <p>Throughout the day, I'll include real-life stories from my cloud clients, with names changed to protect the innocent. I'll explain what worked, what didn't, and what went up in expensive flames.</p>
  <p>You'll learn:</p>
  <p>* How Brent uses the First Responder Kit to assess a cloud SQL Server's wait types<br />* Why each cloud vendor's VM quirks make performance tuning tricky, and how to adapt<br />* How to fix blocking, logging, and CPU issues when the hardware isn't yours<br />* How to write a persuasive performance report for management to fairly lay out where the problem is, and what steps to take next</p>
  <p>By the end of the day, you'll be armed with real-world techniques for keeping your cloud databases faster, cheaper, and more future-proof.</p>
  <p><b>Brent Ozar</b> makes Microsoft SQL Server go faster. He's been working with SQL Server since the late 1990s, and his clients have included Google, Amazon, Stack Overflow, and many other companies you'd love to work with. He loves teaching, travel, and laughing, and lives in Las Vegas.</P>
