    <h3>Session Details:</h3>
    <ul>
    <p>SQL Server performance tuning looks big from a distance, but once you work with real examples it becomes much easier. This workshop is fully hands on. You will learn tuning by fixing real problems step by step, the same way you would in real projects.</p>
    <p>This is workshop with zero (0) slides and 100% demos. Everything you learn happens directly in SQL Server, in real time. You will tune slow queries, build smarter indexes, understand locking behavior, read wait stats, and handle parallelism surprises right in front of your eyes. Every concept comes with an action that you will try yourself.</p>
    <p>You will also hear a short and honest note about AI. The goal is to give you the skills that help you survive the AI transformation. We skip skills that AI can do for you. We focus only on the parts that are real and essential and will keep you valuable in any database team.</p>
    <p>The workshop includes</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Four hours of fast paced demos with real scenarios</li>
    <li>Two hours of guided practice where you solve tasks</li>
    <li>Thirty minutes of AMA time for your burning questions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is lively, engaging, and built to make you confident.</p>
    <p>You will work on tasks such as</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Create the right index for a slow query</li>
    <li>Rewrite a poorly performing query</li>
    <li>Investigate blocking and reduce lock waits using GenAI</li>
    <li>Choose indexes that avoid unnecessary locks</li>
    <li>Read basic wait stats and spot the top bottleneck</li>
    <li>Understand simple parallelism issues and tune them</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By the end, you will know how to find slow spots, tune common queries, and use core tools like execution plans, indexes, waits, and parallelism with confidence. You will also understand which skills matter most in a world where AI is becoming normal.</p>
    <p>Goals</p>
    <p>Learn the fundamentals of SQL Server performance tuning with real hands on tasks</p>
    <p>Understand how indexing, query patterns, locking, waits, and parallelism affect performance</p>
    <p>Build essential tuning skills that stay valuable even during the AI shift</p>
    <p>Prerequisites</p>
    <p>Participants should know basic SQL. No performance tuning experience is needed. Basic SQL Server knowledge helps but is not required.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Pinal Dave</b> is a seasoned SQL Server Performance Tuning Expert and independent consultant. With over 22 years of hands-on experience, he has authored 14 books on SQL Server, created 92 Pluralsight courses, and published more than 5,800 articles on database technology on his blog, SQLAuthority. He also holds a Master of Science degree and multiple database certifications.</p>

    <h3>Session Details:</h3>
    <p><b>Stop building pipelines the slow way.</b></p>
    <p>AI is transforming data engineering, and the gap between those who've adapted and those who haven't is growing every month. This full-day session puts you on the right side of that gap. Whether you're new to Microsoft Fabric Data Factory or you've been building pipelines for years, we meet you where you are. No prerequisites. We start from the ground up.</p>

    <p><b>What we'll build together:</b></p>
    <p>Working pipelines. You'll learn the core mechanics of Fabric Data Factory, the design patterns professional engineers actually use, and how Claude Code can turn days of development into hours. This is code you'll take home and put to work.</p>

    <p><b>Who should attend:</b></p>
    <p>Data engineers, BI developers, IT professionals, and software developers at any level. If you touch data and want to move faster, you belong here.</p>

    <p><b>Who's teaching:</b></p>
    <p>The Leonards are a father-son team with different strengths and one shared obsession: figuring out what actually works. Andy has written books on data engineering. Stephen became the youngest precon presenter in PASS Summit history. Between them, you get decades of hard-won experience and a fresh perspective on where the field is heading.</p>

    <p><b>The promise:</b></p>
    <p>One day. Real skills. Faster pipelines. Every artifact we create together is yours to use and adapt. By the end of this day, you'll see data engineering differently, and you'll work a whole lot faster.</p>

    <h3>Speakers:</h3>
    <p><b>Andy Leonard</b> is a husband, dad, and grandfather; creator of – and Data Philosopher at – DILM (Data Integration Lifecycle Management) Suite; a blogger, founder and Chief Data Engineer at Enterprise Data & Analytics; an SSIS and Azure Data Factory trainer, consultant, and developer; a SQL Server database and data warehouse developer; an author, mentor, engineer, and farmer.</p>
    <p><b>Stephen Leonard</b> With half a decade of experience in IT infrastructure and data management, Stephen specializes in bridging the gap between traditional systems and emerging AI-driven technologies. His expertise spans a broad range of platforms and tools, including Windows and Linux environments, cloud solutions (Azure AZ-900 certified), and enterprise-grade data systems. Stephen brings strong technical proficiency combined with hands-on experience in project management, client communication, and team collaboration.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>We hope you’ll support this event! Please contact us at <a href="mailto:jeff@jefftaylor.io">jeff@jefftaylor.io</a> if you have any questions.</p>

    <h2>Additional Information</h2>
    <p>Day of Data Jacksonville 2026 is produced by and for the community of SQL developers, administrators, and affiliated disciplines. Event Sponsorship does not entail oversight or selection of topics or content.</p>
    <p>Credit card payments can be made online by using Zeffy so we are not charged fees - This link will take you do our Zeffy site: https://bit.ly/sqlsatjax2026sponsorships. On the Zeffy website you do not need to pay for any additional fees. <mark>All funds must arrive two months (March 2, 2026) before the event to be included on printed material.</mark></p>
    <p>While Day of Data Jacksonville requires funds to operate, Sponsorship is also accepted as 'in-kind' contributions where the goods or services provided are those needed for Day of Data. We are especially interested in community groups helping plan and publicize the event. Don't hesitate to get in touch with us if you have any questions about how you can help.</p>
    <p>About 'in-kind' Sponsorships: We distinguish between Sponsors that provide 'cash', and those that supply 'in-kind' Products and Services for raffles or other use. Our reasoning is thus:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>A 'cash' Sponsor provides the raw resource needed to produce Day of Data. In addition, it pays for equipment rental, shirts, lanyards, advertising, refreshments, and meals. Therefore, that sponsor earns significant brand recognition and exposure benefits, as outlined in the Sponsorship 'level' document (Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze, etc.)</li>
      <li>An 'in-kind' sponsor provides an optional resource that we can do without if need be. Also, that optional resource often serves to provide brand recognition and exposure. At past events, some Sponsors have sponsored both at a cash level that was practical for them AND provided branded items to maximize their brand exposure. Those Sponsors then received both sets of benefits as outlined above.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Logistics</h2>
    <p>We'll open the doors to sponsors at 7:30 am. Sponsors will be provided with a table, two chairs, and limited access to 110v power (please let us know what you need in advance). Tables will be in the same area as registration and breakfast to make it easy for attendees to stop by your table. We encourage sponsors to remain on site through the end of the day and have a representative present to present your prize and collect all raffle tickets for use later.</p>
    <p>Lunch will be provided to sponsors that have registered. So please have everyone from your team attending register at <a href="https://www.dayofdata.org/jax">https://www.dayofdata.org/jax</a> so that we can have enough food available.</p>
    <h2>Important Deadlines</h2>
    <p>Sponsorship payments must be received in full no later than <b><mark>March 2, 2026<mark></b> to guarantee inclusion in print and display materials. All sponsor-supplied materials must be received by April 20, 2026. (Do not send anything to arrive before April 13th as we do not have the storage facility any earlier) Contact us for applicable shipping addresses.</p>
    <h2>The Raffle - Your Key to Success</h2>
    <p>The biggest challenge with community events is capturing contact information for follow-ups. Few attendees will have business cards, and having them handwrite their info often leads to a 30% or higher loss due to the inability to read what they wrote! Instead, we provide attendees with a pre-printed badge with a QR code. This code can be scanned and associated with you as the sponsor in our backend system. This gives you 100% readability and 0% loss! It is also more effective than any other technique for capturing contact information. After the event, depending on your sponsorship level, we will provide you with your scanned list.</p>
    <p>Here are the instructions to scan attendees' badges at our event: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvsJtXrgIoc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvsJtXrgIoc</a></p>
    <p>Here is a picture of our badge.</p>
    <p><img src="/assets/img/events/jax/BadgePicture.jpg" alt="sample name badge"></p>
    <p>Because we want you to be successful, all our sponsorship levels include the requirement that you provide a prize of at least $100 in value and a full-color 8-1/2 x 11 flyer highlighting the prize(s) you are providing for the raffle.</p>
    <p>We will have one table for all absentee vendors in the same areas as our onsite vendors. Raffle ticket collection will proceed through the end of the day. If someone from your team is present, we'll ask them to draw the winning ticket. Otherwise, we'll select the ticket. Attendees must be present to win. If there is a physical prize, we'll give it to them. Otherwise, we'll forward their contact information for you to follow up with (for license keys, etc.)</p>
