<h1><a name="sponsorship"></a>Sponsorship Plan</h1>
    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>SQLSaturday Orlando will be held on the campus of Seminole State College on October 8th, 2022. This year we plan to deliver five tracks with each having five one hour presentations, plus three sponsor presentations at lunch and a final end of day gathering for giving away prizes. Our normal attendance is in the range of 250-275, but based on other recent events we are forecasting 125-150 attendees (250+ registrations).</p>
    <h2 id="sponsorship-levels">Sponsorship Levels</h2>
    <p>All sponsors will be listed on our SQLSaturday event page and announced to attendees during the event. All sponsorship fees must be paid in advance of the event. Attendees receive a raffle ticket for each sponsor at the Brand Builder or higher level, we encourage sponsors to bring one or more prizes valued at at least $100 and display it prominently at your table. The raffle tickets will have a QR code that contains the attendee info. We recommend purchasing a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D799ZDD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">2D compatible scanner</a> as they are much faster than using a phone.
