    <p>SQL Saturday Orlando is a free one day training event for IT professionals and students interested in the Microsoft data platform (SQL Server, PowerBI, SSIS, and much more). Free registration is required, you can opt-in for lunch or bring your own, whatever works for you! This year we will have five tracks containing five one hour sessions, plus three sponsored sessions during the lunch break.</p>

    <p>We're also hosting our annual Student to IT Pro Seminar, a block of four 30 minute presentations that start at 9 am that are designed for students attending Seminole State. Students who attend will get extra credit (see your professor for details) and are welcome to stay for the rest of the day and attend any of our data centric presentations.</p>

    <p>SQLSaturday Orlando will be held on the campus of Seminole State College on October 8th, 2022. This year we plan to deliver five tracks with each having five one hour presentations, plus three sponsor presentations at lunch and a final end of day gathering for giving away prizes. Our normal attendance is in the range of 250-275, but based on other recent events we are forecasting 125-150 attendees (250+ registrations).</p>

The raffle tickets will have a QR code that contains the attendee info.
