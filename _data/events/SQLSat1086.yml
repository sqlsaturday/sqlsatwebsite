  <h1>The Cloud Workshop for the SQL Professional</h1>
  <p>Are you thinking, exploring, migrating, or have migrated from SQL Server to Azure? This workshop will provide you with a technically driven approach to translating your knowledge and skills from SQL Server to Azure SQL. You will experience an immersive look at Azure SQL including hands-on labs with no Azure subscription required. This includes topics such as Azure networking, deployment, configuration, security, performance, availability, management, and monitoring.</p>
  <p>This workshop is designed to teach you Azure based on your existing SQL Server knowledge all led by the engineering team at Microsoft that works on both SQL Server and Azure SQL. This workshop is not intended to "sway" you to use Azure. It is designed for those wanting to learn about Azure, those who are migrating some or all SQL Server instances to Azure, or those who have migrated to Azure and want to optimize their investment. You don't even need to be a DBA to gain benefits from this workshop. Just bring your existing SQL Server knowledge and come learn Azure SQL!</p>
