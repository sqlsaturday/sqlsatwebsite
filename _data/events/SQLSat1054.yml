    <h3>Session Details:</h3>
    <p>Developing databases is just the beginning. Once the code has been committed to source control, moving code between environments can be cumbersome in a manual environment. When multiple databases are involved or database changes need to be deployed with other changes, tracking the proper builds of each solution is critical. Otherwise, the quality assurance team may test incompatible builds, leading to wasted time and potentially allowing unsupported changes to be deployed together. This session will introduce database developers and administrators to build and release pipelines in Azure DevOps. Through multiple development tools, participants will gain hands-on experience working with a demonstration database to deploy to a target environment. Dev Ops has many nuances and advanced settings, which this course will not cover.</p>

SQL Saturday Minnesota used to proudly boast one of the largest and broadest events in the country and in 2023 we are looking to rebuild those heights.

    <h2>Additional Information</h2>
    <p>SQL Saturday Minnesota 2023 is produced by and for the community of SQL developers, administrators, and affiliated disciplines. Event Sponsorship does not entail oversight or selection of topics or content.</p>    
    <p>While SQLSaturday Minnesota requires funds to operate, Sponsorship is also accepted as 'in-kind' contributions where the goods or services provided are those needed for SQL Saturday. We are especially interested in community groups helping plan and publicize the event. Don't hesitate to get in touch with us if you have any questions about how you can help.</p>
    <p>About 'in-kind' Sponsorships: We distinguish between Sponsors that provide 'cash', and those that supply 'in-kind' Products and Services for raffles or other use. Our reasoning is thus:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>A 'cash' Sponsor provides the raw resource needed to produce SQL Saturday. In addition, it pays for equipment rental, shirts, lanyards, advertising, refreshments, and meals. Therefore, that sponsor earns significant brand recognition and exposure benefits, as outlined in the Sponsorship 'level' document (Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze, etc.)</li>
      <li>An 'in-kind' sponsor provides an optional resource that we can do without if need be. Also, that optional resource often serves to provide brand recognition and exposure. At past events, some Sponsors have sponsored both at a cash level that was practical for them AND provided branded items to maximize their brand exposure. Those Sponsors then received both sets of benefits as outlined above.</li>
    </ul>
   
    <h2>Important Deadlines</h2>
    <p>Sponsorship payments must be received in full no later than <b><mark>September 1, 2023<mark></b> to guarantee inclusion in print and display materials. </p>
    <h2>The Raffle - Your Key to Success</h2>
    <p>The biggest challenge with community events is capturing contact information for follow-ups. Few attendees will have business cards, and having them handwrite their info often leads to a 30% or higher loss due to the inability to read what they wrote! Instead, we provide attendees with pre-printed raffle tickets containing their name and email address; they can then put these tickets into the raffle box at each sponsor's table to win a prize. This gives you 100% readability and 0% loss! It is also more effective than any other technique for capturing contact information, including scanning their name badge.</p>
    <p>Because we want you to be successful, all our sponsorship levels include the requirement that you provide a prize of at least $100 in value and a full-color 8-1/2 x 11 flyer highlighting the prize(s) you are providing for the raffle.</p>
    <p>We will have one table for all absentee vendors in the same areas as our onsite vendors. Raffle ticket collection will proceed through the end of the day. If someone from your team is present, we'll ask them to draw the winning ticket. Otherwise, we'll select the ticket. Attendees must be present to win. If there is a physical prize, we'll give it to them. Otherwise, we'll forward their contact information for you to follow up with (for license keys, etc.)</p>
