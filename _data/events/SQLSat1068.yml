    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>We hope you’ll support this event! Please contact us at <a href="mailto:jeff@jefftaylor.io">jeff@jefftaylor.io</a> if you have any questions.</p>

    <h2>Additional Information</h2>
    <p>SQL Saturday Jacksonville 2024 is produced by and for the community of SQL developers, administrators, and affiliated disciplines. Event Sponsorship does not entail oversight or selection of topics or content.</p>
    <p>Credit card payments can be made online using PayPal to jaxssug@gmail.com. (An additional fee will be added to cover PayPal fees at the non-profit rate) or checks can be sent to 12375 Sunchase Drive, Jacksonville, FL 32246. <mark>All funds must arrive two months (March 4, 2024) before the event to be included on printed material.</mark></p>
    <p>While SQLSaturday Jacksonville requires funds to operate, Sponsorship is also accepted as 'in-kind' contributions where the goods or services provided are those needed for SQL Saturday. We are especially interested in community groups helping plan and publicize the event. Don't hesitate to get in touch with us if you have any questions about how you can help.</p>
    <p>About 'in-kind' Sponsorships: We distinguish between Sponsors that provide 'cash', and those that supply 'in-kind' Products and Services for raffles or other use. Our reasoning is thus:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>A 'cash' Sponsor provides the raw resource needed to produce SQL Saturday. In addition, it pays for equipment rental, shirts, lanyards, advertising, refreshments, and meals. Therefore, that sponsor earns significant brand recognition and exposure benefits, as outlined in the Sponsorship 'level' document (Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze, etc.)</li>
      <li>An 'in-kind' sponsor provides an optional resource that we can do without if need be. Also, that optional resource often serves to provide brand recognition and exposure. At past events, some Sponsors have sponsored both at a cash level that was practical for them AND provided branded items to maximize their brand exposure. Those Sponsors then received both sets of benefits as outlined above.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Logistics</h2>
    <p>We'll open the doors to sponsors at 7:30 am. Sponsors will be provided with a table, two chairs, and limited access to 110v power (please let us know what you need in advance). Tables will be in the same area as registration and breakfast to make it easy for attendees to stop by your table. We encourage sponsors to remain on site through the end of the day and have a representative present to present your prize and collect all raffle tickets for use later.</p>
    <p>Lunch will be provided to sponsors that have registered. So please have everyone from your team attending register at <a href="https://www.sqlsaturday.com/jax">https://www.sqlsaturday.com/jax</a> so that we can have enough food available.</p>
    <h2>Important Deadlines</h2>
    <p>Sponsorship payments must be received in full no later than <b><mark>March 4, 2024<mark></b> to guarantee inclusion in print and display materials. All sponsor-supplied materials must be received by April 20, 2024. (Do not send anything to arrive before April 15th as we do not have the storage facility any earlier) Contact us for applicable shipping addresses.</p>
    <h2>The Raffle - Your Key to Success</h2>
    <p>The biggest challenge with community events is capturing contact information for follow-ups. Few attendees will have business cards, and having them handwrite their info often leads to a 30% or higher loss due to the inability to read what they wrote! Instead, we provide attendees with pre-printed raffle tickets (see below) containing their name and email address; they can then put these tickets into the raffle box at each sponsor's table to win a prize. This gives you 100% readability and 0% loss! It is also more effective than any other technique for capturing contact information, including scanning their name badge.</p>
    <p><img src="/assets/img/events/jax/samplebadge.jpg" alt="sample name badge"></p>
    <p>Because we want you to be successful, all our sponsorship levels include the requirement that you provide a prize of at least $100 in value and a full-color 8-1/2 x 11 flyer highlighting the prize(s) you are providing for the raffle.</p>
    <p>We will have one table for all absentee vendors in the same areas as our onsite vendors. Raffle ticket collection will proceed through the end of the day. If someone from your team is present, we'll ask them to draw the winning ticket. Otherwise, we'll select the ticket. Attendees must be present to win. If there is a physical prize, we'll give it to them. Otherwise, we'll forward their contact information for you to follow up with (for license keys, etc.)</p>

    <P>We hope you'll support this event! Don't hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:Jeff@JeffTaylor.io">Jeff@JeffTaylor.io</a> if you have any questions.</p>
