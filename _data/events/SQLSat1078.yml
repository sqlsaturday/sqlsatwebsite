  <h2>Tuning Databases in One Day by Brent Ozar</h2>
  <p>You've got production databases in SQL Server or Azure SQL DB, and you want to make 'em faster. You need to identify the database's bottleneck, prove the root cause, and then recommend fixes. You want to make the right choice for each bottleneck - should you do index changes, query tuning, or server-level settings?</p>
  <p>The class will be a mix of 50% slides, and 50% live demos, with plenty of time for Q&A. We'll even cover 3 sample client findings for the most common performance issues so you can see how I explain the issues to my own clients, and give them proof.</p>
