sponsorplan: |
  <p>We appreciate you taking time to consider sponsoring SQL Saturday. This year’s event will be held **virtually on December 3, 2022**. We’ve put together some information that tells a little about our plans for the event in addition to showing you how your company will benefit from being a sponsor at our event.</p>
  <h2>How Much Does It Cost To Be a Sponsor?</h2>
  <P>Since this event is Virtual, we simplified our sponsorship plans to make it even more easy to be a sponsor.<br/>
  <ul><li><b>Personal/blog Sponsorship - $25 prepaid.</b> Your name or blog listed on our closing slides!</li>
  <li>Corporate Sponsorship - $250 prepaid.</b> Name/Logo on Session SQLSaturday Website, on SQLSaturday opening and closing slides and on the PASSMN website for 6 months.</li>
  </ul></p>
  <p>All fees must be paid in advance; we will email you an invoice. Once the invoice is paid, your information and logo will go live on our websites.</p>
  <h2>The Raffle – Your Key to Success!</h2>
  <p>The biggest challenge with virtual community events is capturing contact information for follow ups. We provide attendees with a virtual form that will allow them to submit their name and contact details in exchange for being entered into a raffle to try to win a prize. This gives you 100% readability and 0% loss! It is also more effective than any other technique we’ve seen for trying to capture contact information and that includes scanning their name badge.</p>
  <p>Because we want you to be successful our corporate sponsorship level includes the requirement that you provide a prize of at least $50 in value.</p>
  <p>We will do all the work of collecting the information, and drawing a winner.  After the event we will mail you all the raffle information.</p>
  <h2>Contact Us</h2>
  <p>We hope you’ll support this event! Please contact us at <a ahref="mailto:sqlsaturday@passmn.com">sqlsaturday@passmn.com</a> if you have any questions.</p>
