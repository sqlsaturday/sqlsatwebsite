<h3>I lost my job!  Now what?!?  A survival guide for the unemployed</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You've just been told by HR that you are no longer a part of their organization.  You've been kicked to the curb.  You are now living in the no-man's land called unemployment.

Unemployment is a scary situation.  You're dealing with emotions and uncertainty.  You don't know if you'll be out of work for days, weeks, or months.

Fortunately, unemployment is survivable.  In this session, I'll share my own experiences (and perhaps we'll talk about some of yours) with unemployment, and how I managed to get through the tough times.  We'll discuss emotional impact, the job hunt, and things you can do to get yourself through this tough time.  Hopefully, you'll land on your feet once again before long!</p>

<h3>Query Optimization Explained in 15 Demos</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You've got the hang of writing queries and creating indexes, but once you hit F5 you have no idea what's going to happen. 

* Why did I get that plan? 
* Why didn't you use that index?
* Why are you slow?

In this session, we'll look a little deeper into query optimization, and why SQL Server makes the choices it does. 

This will be fast-paced, demo-heavy and slide-light.</p>

<h3>Don't just code it—Generate It</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Code Generators are all the rage—BIML, JS frameworks, .NET scaffolding, even the humble templates provide by SSMS for views, stored procedures, functions.
Table-driven applications allow one set of code to handle changing business needs. Metadata-driven code generation takes this a giant step further. If you can describe your code with an algorithm operating against a set of data, you can get a computer to produce the code.
 - Source to Target mapping documents can be used to generate the code to effect the mapping.
 - Service Broker activation stored procedures have a clearly defined structure. They can be mass-produced.
 - Standard CRUD stored procedures can be stamped out cookie-cutter fashion.
 - Business rules can be encoded in data and the code to implement them manufactured.
Generated code has systematic errors. Fix the errors at the generator. All the code now works. If the code is so boring that a computer can produce it, why not spend your talent doing something interesting?</p>

<h3>Data To Impress Those That Sign The Checks - Azure Logic Apps, Social Media, and Sentiment Analysis</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The job of a data professional is evolving rapidly, driving many of us to platforms and technologies that were not on our radar screen a few months ago. I am certainly no exception to that trend. Most of us aren't just monitoring backups and tuning queries - we are collaborating with teams throughout the company to provide them data and insights that drive decisions. This presentation walks you through how a silly idea from a soccer podcast got me thinking about how Azure Logic Apps, sentiment analysis, and Azure SQL DB combine to provide potentially powerful insights to any company with a social media and sales presence. Join me as I walk you through building a solution that can impact your company's bottom line - and potentially yours too!</p>

<h3>Accelerating Development and Testing Using Data Virtualization</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Constraining everything in development and testing is database size.  Storage is a bottleneck, and while faster SSD/Flash is available, it is still too expensive due to the size of many databases, especially in DEV and TEST.  More to the point, it takes a lot of time to push terabytes around, and time itself is expensive.  The old joke about "good, fast, and cheap -- pick any two" is so true with data.

Providing full databases for each developer or tester on each task of each project seems unrealistic, when each copy might require terabytes of storage, so for decades everyone has limited themselves to working in shared dev/test environments that are refreshed only every few months, where conflicts occur,  quality suffers, and things move slowly.

Come learn why data virtualization is the solution to a problem everyone knows.

Good, fast, and cheap -- have all three with data virtualization.  Be able to clone data quickly, and remove the biggest constraint to development and testing.</p>

<h3>SQL Server Reporting Services 2017 on Steroids!!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Reporting requests that are required ‘yesterday or sooner’, oft times necessitate working more efficiently and effectively. We have all been through this at one time or another.
In this hands on presentation we shall be looking some of the more challenging techniques of extracting our data from our Multidimensional and Tabular Models, in addition to our Data Mining Models. 
We shall be utilizing concepts of  ‘Openquery()’ and ‘linked servers’ as a means to extract data,  in addition to looking at the way that these two concepts can help us extract our data utilizing MDX, DMX and DAX expressions;  AND YET maintain the  flexibility and the ability to utilize all those wonderful techniques that may  be done with T-SQL.</p>

<h3>Developing AI applications using CNTK Deep Learning</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>While human-like deductive reasoning, inference, and decision-making by a computer is still a long time away. But, there have been remarkable gains in the application of AI techniques and associated algorithms when used to solve real-world problems. One such AI technique that can be leveraged effectively to solve problems is Deep Learning. Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on algorithms inspired by, and partially modeled on biological neural networks called artificial neural networks. 
The Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) is a free, easy-to-use, open-source, commercial-grade toolkit that trains deep learning algorithms to learn like the human brain. This session is meant to explain high level concepts of AI, deep learning, and neural networks using CNTK at a level that can be understood by most non-practitioners.</p>

<h3>Extending DevOps To SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Most organizations are under pressure to speed up the software delivery cycle, whether that’s to respond more quickly to the needs of the business, the needs of your customers or just to keep up with the competition.  Unfortunately the database is commonly considered a bottleneck.  Without the right processes in place, database change management can slow things down, adding risk, uncertainty, and getting in the way of development and operations working together to deliver.  Any organization that wants to fully benefit from a DevOps approach is going to have to overcome some specific challenges presented by the database. This session will teach you how to take DevOps principles and practices and apply them to SQL Server so that you can speed up the database delivery cycle at the same time you protect the information contained within.</p>

<h3>Using Powershell to Manage Your Azure Databases</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Moving your databases to the cloud by implementing Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Data Warehouse can be challenging. These challenges are exacerbated by the fact that you simply don’t have as much tooling available to manage and maintain your databases. Enter Powershell. Through the use of Powershell you can much more easily maintain your Azure databases. Further, once you start using Powershell to maintain the databases, you’ll be able to automate a lot more processes within your Azure environment. This session will provide you with the core knowledge to create your own Powershell scripts and it will give you a set of foundation scripts from which you can build your own. You don’t have to feel limited on what you can do just because you’re on Azure. Powershell will empower you to get more done within your Azure database environment.</p>

<h3>New Storage Paradigms for SQL Server Deployments</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The storage landscape has changed over the past few years. Whether you are still deploying physical servers, virtual machines, or using the public cloud, each has new ways to present storage for SQL Server deployments. Scale Out File Server, Storage Spaces Direct, VSAN, CSV, RDMA/InfiniBand, NVMe, and more are changing how things look on the backend, including network design. The way we approached deploying SQL Server on traditional storage solutions such as SANs often no longer applies. This session will get you caught up on what new storage options you can take advantage of and how to approach architecting your SQL Server solutions in this new, exciting world. Where possible, live demos will be shown.</p>

<h3>Using Azure blob storage for staging data</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Abstract:

Most companies are faced with the ever-growing big data problem.  How can IT professionals help business lines gather and process data from various sources? 

There have been two schools of thought when dealing with big data.  

Schema on write is represented by the traditional relational database.  Raw data is ingested by an extract, transform and load (ETL) process.  The data is stored in tables that enforce integrity and allow for quick retrieval. Only a small portion of the total data owned by the company resides in the database. 

Schema on read is represented by technologies such as Hadoop or PolyBase that  assumed that data integrity was applied during the generation of the text files.  The actual definition of the table is applied during the read operation.  All the data owned by the company can reside in simple storage.

Coverage:

1 - Saving files to blob storage.
2 - How to bulk insert data into Azure DB
3 - Using PolyBase to load an Azure DW
4 - Azure Automation</p>

<h3>SQL Integration Hubs - Bridge Cloud and On-Premise Data Connectivity</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As data has become increasingly vital to core businesses, it has also become more decentralized than ever. Integrating with disparate data presents its own set of challenges, with varying solutions dependent upon your environment and platform.
A Linked Server is a feature of Microsoft SQL Server that allows users to execute federated queries that combine data stored in SQL Server with other linked data sources, whether that is remote SQL Server instances or other databases with ODBC connectivity. Such connections are typically configured using the OLE DB Provider.
With the CData SQL Broker, users can create a Linked Server based on any of the 100+ CData ODBC Drivers and see improved performance, smarter complex query management, and more flexible installation options as compared to using the OLE DB Provider. In this talk, we will discuss the use of Linked Servers, compare the capabilities of Linked Servers created using the OLE DB Provider and CData SQL Broker, and demonstrate creati</p>

<h3>Implementing Data Warehouse Patterns with the Microsoft Data Plat</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You’ve read some of the content of well-known Data Warehousing books – now what? How do you take the structures and disciplines inside such books as the Ralph Kimball series and implement them? This session will take several of the key concepts in Data Warehousing and demonstrate some implementations using SQL Server Integration Services and Analysis Services. We’ll look at items such as Type 2 Changing Dimensions, Confirmed Dimensions, Dimension Outriggers, Role-Playing Relationships, Many-to-Many Bridge table relationships, Factless Fact tables, Handling of NULL foreign key values, ETL patterns, and more</p>

<h3>Using Kafka for Real-Time Data Ingestion with .NET</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Remember that first time you saw Service Broker and thought of all the great things you could do with it? Remember when you actually tried Service Broker and found all the limitations and pain points? Enter Apache Kafka. Apache Kafka is a distributed publish-subscribe messaging system which can scale out to handle millions of messages per second and support a distributed, microservices-oriented architecture. In this talk, we will cover the basics of this powerful system, including general architectural and design principles. We will also build a .NET project which uses Kafka to produce and consume messages quickly and efficiently.</p>

<h3>SSRS for Developers - attendees choose topics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this presentation, I’ll show over a dozen different SSRS topics, and allow attendees to select which topics to cover. Everything from sparklines to heat maps, from Tablix-drilldown reports to advanced charts, from performance gauges to subreport/drilldown reports to new page/group control features in R2….and even topics like data-driven subscriptions, reports against OLAP cubes, and deploying to SharePoint. There are even topics for integrating SSRS reports into ASP.NET pages, and launching SSRS reports using C#. Since no presentation can cover all the topics, I’ll let the majority of the audience decide which to cover.</p>

<h3>Faster SSIS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Ever wonder why SSIS runs so slow? Watch SSIS author Andy Leonard as he runs test loads using sample and real-world data and shows you how to tune SQL Server 2016 Integration Services (SSIS 2016) packages.

We'll start by experimenting with SSIS design patterns to improve performance loading AdventureWorks data. We will implement different change detection patterns and compare execution performance for each. Then, we'll explain a Data Flow Task's bottleneck when loading binary large objects - or Blobs. 

Finally, we'll demonstrate a design pattern that uses a Script Component in a Data Flow to boost load performance to MySql, whether on-premises or in the cloud.</p>

<h3>Introducing SSIS in the Cloud!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Many organizations have hesitated to migrate on-prem databases to the Azure SQL Database platform because they still needed a server and license to run SSIS.
