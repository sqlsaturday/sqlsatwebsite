<h3>Using Hive to Query and Process Big Data</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Writing map-reduce jobs to process data is not a trivial experience. To do this effectively you really need to be a seasoned java or C# programmer. Even then it is a time consuming experience. A very useful tool available to create and run Map-reduce jobs in Hadoop is Hive. HiveQL is a declarative language modeled to provide a similar experience as writing SQL. If you are familiar with SQL the use of HiveQL should be very intuitive. With HiveQL you construct and run the statement, submitting it to a query engine. The query engine transforms the query into a series of map-reduce jobs. By not having to worry about the low level coding you become much more productive and can concentrate on data analysis. This session is designed to get you up to speed and productive with hive. It includes several practical examples in order to make data analysis with hive as concrete as possible.</p>

<h3>Beyond Stereotypes: Equality, Gender Neutrality, and Valuing Team Diversity</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Are there times when you feel the “odd one out” on your team? Do you have to make an effort to fit in? Often, even when there isn’t blatant sexism, racism or other discrimination in play, there can still be a lot of peer pressure to conform to the group and consequences if you don’t. Join us as our panel discusses some central questions around promoting equality and respect in the workplace. We’ll discuss hard topics like how to establish, build, and grow relationships with co-workers in a diverse setting, how to deal with situations where you – or a colleague – suffer from social exclusion, and how to arrange social events that are inclusive and promote teamwork in a professional setting.  And we’ll share ideas on what we can do to enhance each individual’s contributions and build stronger, more effective teams.

<h3>Using Apache Solr with SQL for Text Searching</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Big Data is quickly becoming THE thing to do.  Even Microsoft is getting in on the game with HDInsight and Azure.  In this session we will cover how to use Apache Solr, a Lucene based Open Source search engine, to provide text indexing and search capabilities and how to integrate it with SQL Server.  Not only can Solr provide a full range of indexing and search features, but it can also be used to help improve performance of some queries commonly used in SQL Server by offloading them to Solr (the ubiquitous field search procedures as one example).

The session will cover some basics about how Solr works, starting and customizing Solr, indexing documents, search features, and how to integrate with SQL Server.

<h3>Analysis Services Relational Querying – Why Bother?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With Microsoft Analysis Services being one of the most scalable multi-dimensional OLAP tools on the market, the relational OLAP storage method has traditionally not been given much consideration.  With the release of SQL 2012, the Tabular model was introduced and offered lightning fast columnar storage and a direct query option.  Is there a reason to consider, or reconsider, Analysis Services relational querying capability given the current technology landscape?

Data is more valuable when it is timely.  Overnight processing windows are not always available in systems that need intra-day loads or in global systems.   With a good design, relational queries can leverage the constantly improving database technologies including the use of columnar indexes and massively parallel processing (MPP) to provide business value at speed and scale.

This session will review the case for relational querying as well as the behaviors of Analysis Services operating in ROLAP and direct query modes.</p>

<h3>Effective Data Warehouse Storage Patterns</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Abstract:

Many companies start off with a simple data mart for reporting. As the company grows, users become dependent on the data mart for monitoring and making decisions on Key Performance Indicators (KPI).

Unexpected information growth in your data mart may lead to a performance impacted reporting system. In short, your users will be lining up at your cube for their daily reports.

How do you reduce the size of your data mart and speed up data retrieval?

This presentation will review the following techniques to fix your woes.

Coverage:

1 – What is horizontal partitioning?
2 – Database sharding for daily information.
3 – Working with files and file groups.
3 – Partitioned views for performance.
4 – Table and Index partitions.
5 – Row Data Compression.
6 – Page Data Compression.
7 – Programming a sliding window.
8 – What are Federations in Azure SQL?</p>

<h3>Visual Analytics with HDInsight and Power View</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>BIG DATA!  There, I've said it.  But, what exactly does it mean for YOU?

This session will help to dispel some of the Big Data confusion.  This session will focus on HD Insight, Microsoft's Hadoop based implementation.  Loading data and querying a database is one thing and that will certainly be covered. Exploring how we can integrate data from HD Insight into our existing analytic solutions is one of the real world implementations this session will be focused on.  This is one of the keys to successfully selling management on the needs for a Big Data solution. It's not just another database, it's a tool to enhance existing analytic structures.

During this session, we'll start with a brief overview of Hadoop and HDFS. Next we'll take a look at HD Insight, and explore some of the features therein.

Finally, integration with SSAS and Power View (using Excel 2013) will be shown, which will close the loop on Big Data visualizations.

<h3>SQL 2012 Table Compression</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server 2008 has introduced Table compression to the DBA toolkit.  We all know there are different kinds of compression available in SQL Server.  What some may not know is the subtleties of compression.  Such subtleties include that not all Page Compressed tables are entirely page compressed.  This session will show you how to reach into the database and discover compression states at the page level.  At the lower level, this session will also show how to determine compression settings of objects in the database.  Participants will be able to use undocumented commands as well as commands such as PIVOT to derive some interesting information from the database engine.</p>

<h3>Hybrid Solutions: The Future of SQL Server Disaster Recovery</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The cloud is a polarizing buzzword in IT, especially for DBAs. The reality is that all of us will be affected by it over the next few years in one way or another much like we have been by virtualization. One of the best uses for the cloud is creating disaster recovery easier than we have been able to do in the past. This session will discuss the cloud from a SQL Server DBA perspective and how things like hybrid on premise/cloud solutions can be architected today to bring resiliency to current solutions with features like availability groups in SQL Server 2012 and 2014.</p>

<h3>Securing a Multi-Database Application</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>It is difficult enough to implement database security when dealing with only a single database. If multiple databases are involved, the task of providing a security model that follows industry best practices seems insurmountable.

In this session, we will do a quick review of access security best practices and then dive into the four different methods a DBA can use to tighten cross database access security. For each one we will walk through a demo and talk about how to implement it in your own environment. We will close the session with a discussion about the advantages and disadvantages of the four methods.

<h3>The Business Intelligence Management Data Mart</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Once you've built you're Business Intelligence ecosystem, you want to ensure that everything is running smoothly. SSIS packages should be timely, analysis services databases should be logging their usage, and reports should be monitored for improvement where, and when, possible. In this session, we'll start out by discussing why a management data mart is a good thing, and why you need this tool in your business intelligence environment to properly monitor and manage usage. Later, we'll discuss how to report off of this new data mart and the best way to deliver this report to management or your DBA for some much needed insight.</p>

<h3>Optimizing Bulk Insert Operations</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Why is the ETL slow?  How come this simple insert takes so long?  What is minimal logging and how can this be achieved?  This session will explore how to improve the performance of bulk insert operations with consideration to database settings, indexes, constraints and trace flag 610.  We will compare performance between different methods of bulk insert and discuss how each can be tuned for better performance.   </p>

<h3>Your SQL Server Environment--Fair or Foul?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Determine what's in play and what's not.

This presentation will focus on steps you can take to determine the performance of your SQL Server and where you may need to spend some time optimizing.  We will review tools and scripts that are available from Windows Server and the SQL community so you won't have to go and ask your boss to buy something. </p>

<h3>Bulk Insert, Temp Tables  Computed Columns, T-SQL Techniques</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Bulk Insert, friend or foe?  Temp Tables,  evil in code or divine inspiration? Computed Columns, useless performance sucking waste of time or silver bullet solution?  Do you use any of these, love them, hate them, never tried or even heard of these techniques? Learn the good the bad and the ugly of using the Bulk Insert, Temp Tables and Computed Columns in T-SQL. They are powerful tools when used properly.  When used together they can make for robust high performance ETL solutions</p>

<h3>Parsing T-SQL using the TransactSql.ScriptDom library (C#)</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>T-SQL is a very complicated language to parse, so it can be intimidating to get started. We'll go over basic concepts of what a lexer/parser is and what to expect from it. Then, using the TransactSql.ScriptDom library in the SQL Server SDK, we'll do some examples to get our feet wet.
