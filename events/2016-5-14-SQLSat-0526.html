<h3>Getting Started with MDX</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session, led by Microsoft BI Architect, SQL Server MVP AND SSAS Maestro Bill Pearson, we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2 and above . We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.

<h3>Should I move my database to the cloud?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>So you have been running on-prem SQL Server for a while now.  Maybe you have taken the step to move it from bare metal to a VM, and have seen some nice benefits.  Ready to see a TON more benefits?  If you said "YES!", then this is the session for you as I will go over the many benefits gained by moving your on-prem SQL Server to an Azure VM (IaaS).  Then I will really blow your mind by showing you even more benefits by moving to Azure SQL Database (PaaS/DBaaS).  And for those of you with a large data warehouse, I also got you covered with Azure SQL Data Warehouse.  Along the way I will talk about the many hybrid approaches so you can take a gradual approve to moving to the cloud.  If you are interested in cost savings, additional features, ease of use, and ending the days of upgrading hardware, this is the session for you!</p>

<h3>SQL Server Automation with PowerShell</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>DBA’s are constantly faced with challenges in maintaining a healthy SQL Server environment. Monitoring our database servers, deploying database code changes and performing database restores are just a few examples of a day in the life of a DBA. As workloads increase, performing these tasks manually introduces more opportunity for human error and time starts to become our bottleneck. The only option if you want to stay above water is to become more efficient at what you do. Enter automation. Enter PowerShell.

Initially released in 2006, PowerShell has grown to become Microsoft's premier scripting language on the Windows platform. This presentation will begin with a brief overview of the PowerShell language itself, but the primary focus will be on how to interface with SQL Server to help automate your database environment.</p>

<h3>Rx for Demystifying Index Tuning Decisions</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Indexes are one of the most troubling and mysterious areas for DBAs and developers.  Adding, deleting, or modifying them can yield dramatically positive or negative changes in query performance.  The mystery is knowing how indexes need to be adjusted and what outcomes will result.  This uncertainty often leads to great reluctance to eliminate indexes that are used sparingly or only because the optimal ones are missing.  This leads to index proliferation, which ultimately produces inconsistent and poor query performance.  Some believe that the SQL Server Database Tuning Advisor will solve all these issues, but it frequently does not.  In fact, it often compounds the proliferation problem significantly.  This presentation will enable a DBA to make informed decisions regarding what query and index metrics to monitor, determine how indexes are used, and devise appropriate index strategies to improve query performance through index addition, deletion, or modification. </p>

<h3>Hacking Expos#233; - Using SSL to Secure SQL Server Connections</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You know all the ways to protect your database when it is at rest, but what about when someone connects and starts running some queries? What if they connect and don't do anything? Just how exposed is that data? 
We will assume the role of a hacker and, by using a simple technique, we will sniff packets on a network to reveal what data is being sent. You may be shocked! 
We will then secure our database connections with a simple self-signed SSL certificate. 
Once secured, we will resume the role of the hacker and look inside the packets to see what has changed. 
*Warning - Do not try these demos at work without proper permissions as actual hacking techniques are used.

<h3>New Paradigm for Performance Tuning in SQL Server 2016</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server 2016 is introducing some new tools for analyzing and troubleshooting queries that is going to change the way we do performance tuning. It's not just new tools, it's a whole new paradigm.

SQL Server 2016 will introduce the Query Store and the Plan Compare Tool which will help you to quickly analyze and troubleshoot problem queries, diagnose the root-cause of query slow-downs, force execution plans and prevent future plan regressions, and track actual execution plan run-time statistics.

Have you ever had a job run unusually slow at 2 AM? If you are using Query Store, diagnosing the problem is as easy as looking at the execution data and plan for the 2 AM execution.

Does a query run fast with one plan but slow with another? With the plan compare tool, you can compare 2 plans in the same window to identify what is the same and what is different.</p>

<h3>Data Migration Using BIML</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Many companies scale out their databases horizontally, partitioning data by customer (or some other identifier) into separate databases or instances.  Sometimes, it becomes important to move that data from one database to another.  SQL Server Integration Services is a fantastic tool for ETL, but creating and maintaining dozens or hundreds of data flows by hand is exhaustingly tedious.  Instead of doing it the hard way, use the BI Markup Language (BIML) to automate package development.  This talk will show how we can use metadata tables and BIML to auto-create SSIS packages to migrate data from one database to another, handling foreign key constraints along the way.</p>

<h3>Pragmatic Power BI:  Working with Data Sources</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Power BI (either Desktop or the service) supports a wide (and growing) range of data sources.  From the sources with which most IT pros and data analysts are regularly involved (relational and OLAP databases, text and similar files, etc.) to sources that are a little more out of the ordinary for some of us (OData, MS Exchange, Active Directory, and a growing list of others), these reservoirs and suppliers of data grow increasingly more valuable in self-service BI.  
In this session, BI Architect, SQL Server MVP and Analysis Services Maestro Bill Pearson focuses upon the first step in working with data sources in Power BI:  connecting to, and extracting data from, a diverse range of data sources. Throughout the session, we explore various sources and witness how to employ Power BI with each.

<h3>Learning and Optimizing the SQL Server Plan Cache</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server memory management is one of the most important aspects of a writing T-SQL code. And yet many of us don’t know the fundamentals beyond “SQL Server will take care of that”. In this session, we’ll go deep into the internal behavior of the plan cache. We’ll cover four main problem scenarios within the plan cache, what causes them, and how to fix them, including:

1.	Bloating – scenarios that cause SQL Server to needlessly waste space in the plan cache. 
2.	Suboptimal plans – scenarios where SQL Server can’t help but choose a bad execution plan, usually self-inflicted.
3.	Parameter sniffing – situations in which SQL Server specifically chooses a bad execution plan do to the type of parameters pass into T-SQL code.
4.	Recompiles – situations where SQL Server is unable to completely process a block of T-SQL code without having to recompile it. 

If you don’t know much about SQL Server memory management, especially if you write T-SQL code, then this session is for you! You’ll learn </p>

<h3>Relational databases vs Non-relational databases</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There is a lot of confusion about the place and purpose of the many recent non-relational database solutions (“NoSQL databases”) compared to the relational database solutions that have been around for so many years.  In this presentation I will first clarify what exactly these database solutions are, compare them, and discuss the best use cases for each.  I’ll discuss topics involving OLTP, scaling, data warehousing, polyglot persistence, and the CAP theorem.  We will even touch on a new type of database solution called NewSQL.  If you are building a new solution it is important to understand all your options so you take the right path to success.</p>

<h3>Version control with GIT for the DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In 2005, Linus Torvalds developed the version control system (VCS) git. Since then, it has become as platform agnostic and ubiquitous as the internet. In that same note, github, the most popular service for hosting git repositories has become so ubiquitous that Microsoft chose to host the source code for its OSS fork of the .NET framework there instead of its own codeplex.

What does this mean to a DBA? Whether or not you use SSDT, you should be storing your database schema in version control. In addition, your utility scripts certainly belong in VCS. 

In my session. We'll cover:

What is version control?
How does a distributed version control system differ from traditional version control like Visual Sourcesafe, TFS, and SVN?
How do I setup git for internal use in my company?
How do I host public and private repositories on github.
How do pull requests work?
How do I fork a SVN repo to github?

We will be covering using git from both the command line and Visual Studio.</p>

<h3>Statistics  Cardinality – How they work to find data efficiently</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Are your statistics up to date? 
Yes, it’s that dreaded phrase you hear all the time when it comes to performance tuning your SQL Server. What does it matter? Why should I care about statistics? Aren’t they automatic or something like that?
In this session we will go over why statistics matter, how they are generated, how they impact performance, and even how to maintain them. Once we have that all settled, we will take a quick look at how the cardinality estimator uses statistics to determine a ‘good enough’ plan to use. We will close out the session by taking a look at the performance impact from a simple upgrade of your SQL Server to 2014 and using the new cardinality estimator.

<h3>Inside the Black Box - Making Sense of Service Broker</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server Service Broker is often seen as a black box. Messages go in, and hopefully they come out on the other side.  But when they don't, DBAs typically don’t know where to look. Trying to figure out what’s wrong quickly turns into a guessing game.
It’s not that complicated once you understand how it all works. 
Service Broker is an asynchronous messaging technology built into SQL Server that allows you to scale out your application, replicate data or perform ETL, all while guaranteeing messages are delivered and processed in the right order.   In this session, we'll discuss the basics of the Service Broker architecture, its components, and deployment options.  We will discuss troubleshooting tips and performance best practices to help you deploy a Service Broker solution in your own environment.

<h3>Disaster Documents: The role of documentation in disaster recovery</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>I was an employee of a company that had an office in the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001.  Prior to that infamous date, I had written several departmental documents that ended up being critical to our recovery.  In this presentation, I provide a narrative of what happened in the weeks following 9/11, and how documentation played a role in getting the organization back on its feet.

While other disaster recovery presentations talk about strategies, plans, and techniques, this presentation focuses on the documentation itself.  We will discuss the documents we had and how they were used in our recovery.  We will also discuss what documents we didn't have, and how they could have made the process better.</p>

<h3>Continuous Integration with SSDT and Team Foundation Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) is Microsoft developer tools for working with SQL Server databases on premises and in the cloud. It supersedes Management Studio in development functionality. Team Foundation Server (TFS) is the collaboration platform at the core of Microsoft’s application lifecycle management (ALM) solution. TFS gives you the tools you need to effectively manage software development projects throughout the IT lifecycle. In this session, we are going to focus on the interaction between SSDT and TFS. Developing locally and publishing the changes to an on-premises instance of SQL Server. We will look at how we can do continuous integration between development and other environments pushing the schema changes and upgrading the version numbers in a seamless manner upon successful build of the solution. Furthermore we'll look at how to lift the integration to an even greater level by using Microsoft Release Management thus automating the deployment and testing of your software.</p>

<h3>Advanced BIML - for the advanced ETL developer</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This is not your regular Agile BIML session. By now you already know that BIML is a great productivity enhancement to SSIS. You also know that you can build metadata driven solution and include C# code in your BIML scripts or snippets. If you don't know what I'm talking about this session is not for you. If you - on the other hand - want to know how to build a modular BIML framework, do real C# development and include it in your BIML code so that you can pass custom objects around for optimized performance and code reuse then this session is for you. We will see how to build a reusable C# framework that can be obfuscated and deployed to customers without worrying about Intellectual property. I promise you no more than a few slides but a lot of demos and real life experience acquired from major BIML projects. We will also have a look at how to harness integration and unit tests in the setup with a twist of Continuous Integration with Team Foundation Server.</p>

<h3>10 Things Administrators of BI Systems Should Know</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Conversations about SQL Server administration tends to be all about administering OLTP systems. If you administrer BI systems, you can't apply everything you know about administering OLTP systems to BI systems.
