<h3>The Science of Success: Building Faith in a Data Warehouse</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>For data professionals, understanding why a modern data warehouse doesn't get adopted immediately and broadly in an organization can be difficult.  Data in your warehouse is arguably of better quality and in a more usable form than what's in the systems you source your data from… so where does this reluctance come from, and how do you overcome it?
Despite our broad expertise of data tools, the robotic consistency of the computational resources they leverage, and the immutable GIGO law - presenting a reasoned and thorough validation process often isn't enough.  Trust isn't given instantly, it has to be earned.  The strongest faith is built by participation, and repetition.
Learn how to leverage your tooling expertise in SSIS and SQL to build a dead-simple framework to build faith in data.  Leverage analyst and business user questions and angst into repeatable, consistent proof of correctness - that's the science of success for a data warehouse.</p>

<h3>U-SQL Killer scenarios: Custom Processing, Big Cognition, Image and JSON processing at Scale</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When analyzing big data, you often have to process data at scale that is not rectangular in nature and you would like to scale out your existing programs and cognitive algorithms to analyze your data. To address this need and make it easy for the programmer to add her domain specific code, U-SQL includes a rich extensibility model that allows you to process any kind of data, ranging from CSV files over JSON and XML to image files and add your own custom operators. In this presentation, we will provide some examples on how to use U-SQL to process interesting data formats with custom extractors and functions, including JSON, images, use U-SQL’s cognitive library and finally show how U-SQL allows you to invoke custom code written in Python and R.</p>

<h3>Azure Data Technologies Overview</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With the shift to microservice architectures, gone are the days where all of an organization’s data is stored in a single, massive, relational database. We’re quickly shifting to a polyglot persistence approach for dealing with data — using separate data stores that are each best suited to the data being stored.

We’ll look at the wide variety of managed services available to store data on Microsoft Azure including the usual suspects such as SQL DB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Table Storage, and others like Cosmos DB, Redis, Search, and more. The audience will walk away with a broad understanding of Azure’s data portfolio and  be able select the right tools to meet their data persistence needs.</p>

<h3>How a traditional CMS went from on-prem SQL Server to Azure based CosmosDB, Search, Stream Analytics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Learn the journey of an Open Source Content Management's move from on premise to the cloud. DNN (formerly known as DotNetNuke) has traditionally been an on-premise solution on IIS and SQL Server. While building a new solution for content management we literally hit a limit with the on-premise Sql Server tools. We needed a schema free database - DocumentDB came to rescue. Find out why we didn't go with MongoDB. We also needed search capability, where Azure Search became the tool of choice. We need logging and telemetry from our application - App Insights was chosen. We also use Event Hubs, Stream Analytics and Data Lake. I will talk about all of these here, and present you a full picture on how to build real life scalable business applications using Azure technologies. We will focus mostly on the Data aspects of the architecture in this session.</p>

<h3>Cloud Data Platforms for the SQL Server DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With the proliferation of both SQL and NoSQL databases, organizations can now target specific fit-for-purpose database tools for their different application needs regarding scalability, ease of use, ACID support, etc. 

Platform as a Service offerings make this even easier now, enabling developers to roll out their own database infrastructure in minutes with minimal management overhead. However, this same amount of flexibility also comes with the challenges of picking the right tool, on the right provider and with the proper expectations. All of these are new challenges that are coming into the field of responsibility of the SQL DBA professional.

In this session we'll compare the NoSQL and SQL offerings from AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, their use cases for each one based on our own client projects, and how they are different to the different SQL Server features we are familiar with.</p>

<h3>Why Should I Care About ... Partitioned Views?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Partitioned tables are awesome and partitioned views are dead, right? Well, sure partitioned views are not sexy but there are still plenty of applications where they are critical. And not necessarily just for standard edition who aren't on the new service pack yet. If your data is time stamped, do you see different queries run against older data than new data? Do you with you could segment your data across multiple columns? Do you have data you need to partition horizontally? It's possible partitioned views may still be for you. Come hear why this is still an important topic long after cargo pants and trucker hats went away ... and possibly even after 2016 SP1.</p>

<h3>DAX Filters: A Quest for Clarity</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If you are working with SSAS Tabular, Power BI, or good ol' Power Pivot for Excel, you've likely run into a need for DAX, the formula and query language of these tools.  A very common task is to augment, override, or otherwise modify a filter context.  This sounds easy enough, but if you've had experience beyond simple filters, the syntax and behavior may seem confusing, or worse, counter-intuitive. The purpose of this presentation is to discuss the different types of filters, their behavior, and their interactions with other DAX formulas.</p>
