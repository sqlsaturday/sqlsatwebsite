<h3>How In-Memory Database Objects Affect Database Design</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With SQL Server 2014, Microsoft has added a major new feature to help optimize OLTP database implementations by persisting your data primarily in RAM. Of course it isn't that simple, internally everything that uses this new feature is completely new. While the internals of this feature may be foreign to you, accessing the data that uses the structures very much resembles T-SQL as you already know it. As such, the first important question for the average developer will be how to adapt an existing application to make use of the technology to achieve enhanced performance. In this session, I will start with a normalized database, and adapt the logical and physical database model/implementation in several manners, performance testing the tables and code changes along the way.</p>

<h3>Getting Started with MDX</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session, led by Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson, we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.   This session applies equally to Analysis Services 2008, 2008R2 and 2012.</p>

<h3>Silent Performance Killers Lurking in Your Code</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Design patterns that work well in traditional application development often mutate into anti-patterns and blunder, unwittingly, into stored procedures and other database objects. Modularized code for code reuse which can impact execution plans, looping through all rows to get aggregated data, and working in a “top down” fashion instead of leveraging sub-queries  are just a few of these anti-patterns. We’ll take a look at better ways to address the issues these anti-patterns bring into your code, ways that are more efficient in SQL Server. We'll talk about the correct use of user-defined functions. We'll see how to leverage t-SQL windows functions can provide aggregated in an efficient set based manner.  By moving away from these poor programming patterns, you can gain better performance from your database.</p>

<h3>Read Dirty to Me - Isolation Levels/User Impact</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Issue a "SELECT {data} FROM {myTable}" statement and users need to trust the data returned is accurate. What happens when multiple processes access the same data? What happens further if one of those process is an UPDATE or even a DELETE statement? How about if both processes will be updating that data? Understanding Isolation in SQL Server is paramount in ensuring data integrity in your system. We will cover the different levels of isolation and how they impact what a user views when accessing the data at a given point-in-time.</p>

<h3>A Day in the Life of a Row: Internals Deep Dive</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The SQL Server Query Processor does a great job of hiding all the dirty work necessary to display, store, and delete data. But when it's time to tune performance, the more you know, the better decisions you will make. In this T-SQL demo-heavy deep-dive session, we'll follow the Query Processor as it rips through a database and discover the steps it takes responding to our queries.
Attend this advanced session and you will be able to: * View and interpret raw data and metadata with DMVs, XEvents, and DBCC commands, including some undocumented ones (all demo scripts included in session download) * View and describe, with precise details, exactly what data and metadata actions any given query took, and, * Attack and destroy query performance problems with some neat new weapons.

<h3>Getting Started With SQL Server Replication</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session we will examine how SQL Server replication works.  A technology that has been around, this tool is not going anywhere anytime soon.  It's an excellent way to keep a subset of data synched with another database without having to synch the entire thing (although you could if you wanted to!).  We will examine terms, internals, and walk through the setup of transactional and snapshot replication pieces so you can implement this technology in your environment and use it as a valuable tool in your personal knowledge book.  This class is targeted towards junior and mid level DBAs who have little to no experience with replication or developers looking to broaden their knowledge and toolkit for moving data.</p>

<h3>Introduction to SQL Server Integration Services</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>

<h3>How are your SSAS cubes and Tabular Models Performing</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Which objects within your SSAS cubes or models are consuming the most CPU?  Which objects are using the most memory?  What MDX query is running the longest? What are the top 10 MDX queries consuming resources? Which objects (dimensions or facts) are having the most cache misses?  Which of your measure groups are having the most aggregation misses.

You could be the hero of your BI group in recommending changes to the cube or model structures and in planning when to purchase more memory or storage.  By using SSAS Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) or using PowerShell scripts to collect statistics on SSAS Performance Counters, you can easily build charts and reports to identify resource bottlenecks in your SSAS cubes and models.


Both SSAS multidimensional cubes and Tabular models consume system resources differently; but you  can collect data and store performance  statistics in SQL tables to build your performance monitoring solution for both types.</p>

<h3>Using Extended Events in SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Extended Events were introduced in SQL Server 2008.  With SQL 2014, we have seen a significant upgrade to this feature.  Join me for a little adventure into the realm of extended events.  We will discuss how to use extended events to aid in performance tuning and in day to day administration.  We will also explore some background and the architecture of extended events.  This is a fast paced session and will be a lot of fun. Attendees will be able to take back several sample XE sessions to help troubleshoot different issues and get to more intimately know their data/environment.</p>

<h3>Leveraging CDC and SSIS for ODS/DM/DW Loads</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>One of the challenges with loading ODS/DM/DW is gathering data and reducing performance impact.  Change Data Capture (CDC) is a means to capture all the changes of a given table, but how do you load this data to another Database.  We will walk through the process and considerations for loading data using SSIS package and how to detect changes to the CDC Configured Tables which has been known to cause SSIS Package failures.</p>

<h3>Table Vars and Temp Tables – What you NEED to Know!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Almost every SQL Developer is familiar with Table Variables and Temporary Tables. While each of these objects represents temporary storage, there are also substantial differences between them. Understanding the differences between Table Variables and Temporary Tables, and the ramifications that those differences cause, is essential to being able to properly select the appropriate object for use in your development tasks. In this code filled session, we’ll discover the differences and similarities of Temporary Tables and Table Variables, dispel some widespread myths about each, and answer the most important questions of them all, "When do I use one or the other and what are the various impacts of doing so?"</p>

<h3>Revenge: The SQL! - Director's Cut</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Pop quiz DBA: Your developers are running rampant in production. Logic, reason, and threats have all failed. You're on the edge. What do you do? WHAT DO YOU DO?

Hint: You attend Revenge: The SQL! 

This session will show you how to "correct" all those bad practices. Everyone logging in as sa? Running huge cursors? Using SELECT * and ad-hoc SQL? Stop them dead, without actually killing them. Ever dropped a table, or database, or WHERE clause? You can prevent that! And if you’re tired of folks ignoring your naming conventions, make them behave with Unicode…and take your revenge!

Revenge: The SQL! is fun and educational and may even have some practical use, but you’ll want to attend simply to indulge your Dark Side. Revenge: The SQL! assumes no liability and is not available in all 50 states. Do not taunt Revenge: The SQL! or Happy Fun Ball.</p>

<p>Often in supporting SQL Server, we are asked to troubleshoot why a user or application cannot connect.  It becomes more challenging when we find nothing is wrong with the way SQL Server is running.  In this session we review common mistakes to the configuration of network settings.  We’ll also show how to troubleshoot the SQL Server Browser.  We’ll cover how to test for firewall issues.  Finally we’ll discuss why SQL Server is blamed for dropping its connections.</p>

<h3>Database: The Motion Picture</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Power up your data presentations with Power View and Power Map. Charts and maps can be made interactive, generated on the fly, or recorded as video with a soundtrack and special effects. Instead of trying to make your point with a boring list of names, numbers, and dates, put on your movie director's hat and give your data the Hollywood treatment as you yell, "Lights! Cameras! Action!"</p>

<h3>Spatial Data - Looking Outside the Map</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>I've said it before and I'll say it again, spatial data doesn't get much love in SQL Server.  It is a feature worthy of much appreciation and will become more vital as more location data is collected.  In this session we will explore spatial data and discover many ways it can be used for incredible analytics.  You will learn some new ways to visualize your data outside of the typical plots on a Bing map layer.  Come and learn how powerful spatial data can be even though it lacks a snazzy "power" title.</p>
