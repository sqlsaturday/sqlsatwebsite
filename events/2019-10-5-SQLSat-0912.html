<h3>T-SQL Window Function Deep Dive</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Join this session and learn everything you need to know about T-SQL windowing functions!

SQL Server 2005 and later versions introduced several T-SQL features that are like power tools in the hands of T-SQL developers. If you aren’t using these features, you’re probably writing code that doesn’t perform as well as it could. This session will teach you how to avoid cursor solutions and create simpler code by using the windowing functions that have been introduced between 2005 and 2012. You'll learn how to use the new functions and how to apply them to several design patterns that are commonly found in the real world.

You will also learn what you need to know to take full advantage of these features to get great performance. We’ll also discuss which features perform worse or better than older techniques, what to watch out for in the execution plan, and more.</p>

<h3>SQL DevOps Simplified with Production Databases</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>DevOps is based on building an application binary (immutable artifact) that supports a highly reliable, repeatable engineering process.  In the case of SQL Server, however, a database is already in production, and isn’t simply replaced (as an app binary), but is upgraded.   Current SQL Server DevOps methods use source control to build a “development” database, with schema and objects and static data needed for functional testing.  "Near production data" is used in Staging, and finally production is upgraded.  This approach involves complexity, and breaks the principle of working with immutable artifacts throughout the process.  Our session introduces a new approach to SQL Server DevOps, with production databases used in all stages.   Production database clones are delivered more quickly than "built" databases, are more easily integrated with source control, and produces higher fidelity outcomes.  Learn how leading enterprises are simplifying SQL DevOps.</p>

<h3>Predictive Analytics with R in Power BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Power BI reports are typically used for descriptive analysis: a historical look of what has happened. But what if your report could visualize what is likely to happen and recommend what you can do about it now? This session will cover how to shift from descriptive to predictive analysis and leverage the power of machine learning to enhance your business intelligence solutions. The basics and best practices of predictive modeling will be introduced, and these concepts will be applied to create three predictive models in R using three different techniques. We will then walk through the three different ways to integrate the predictive power of these models into a Power BI report.</p>

<h3>SQL Server Reporting Services 2017 on Steroids!!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Reporting requests that are required ‘yesterday or sooner’, oft times necessitate working more efficiently and effectively. We have all been through this at one time or another.
In this hands on presentation we shall be looking some of the more challenging techniques of extracting our data from our Multidimensional and Tabular Models, in addition to our Data Mining Models. 
We shall be utilizing concepts of  ‘Openquery()’ and ‘linked servers’ as a means to extract data,  in addition to looking at the way that these two concepts can help us extract our data utilizing MDX, DMX and DAX expressions;  AND YET maintain the  flexibility and the ability to utilize all those wonderful techniques that may  be done with T-SQL.</p>

<h3>Easing the pain of database migrations, a closer look at the new cloud citizen - DMS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>An essential part of migrating your application workload to the cloud is how to transfer your data securely to its new home. If you in addition want to change the underlying database system, for instance Oracle to SQL Server, it can quickly escalate to an overwhelming task. What if your application have a very high uptime requirement and your database is so large that you don't have a downtime window long enough to do a traditional backup/restore operation?
In order to overcome these pain points we have now available, both in Azure and AWS, services and tools that alleviate these pains and brings your valuable data safely across with near-zero downtime.

In this talk we will:
- Guide you through how to set up a migration process with checks and balances
- Compare the schema analysis and conversion tools provided by AWS and Microsoft
- Compare the migration services provided by AWS and Azure
- Demonstrate near-zero-downtime migration for a live database on AWS and Azure</p>

<h3>New features in Management Studio  -- Performance Troubleshooting made easier!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is now updated each month with the latest version of the SQL Client Tools.  Which enabled rapid enhancement to Execution Plan.  

Do you know that you can now see how many pages are spilled to disk for a sort, as well as the memory statistics for the operator? Are you aware that you can see the top 10 waits for an execution and what trace flags were active during compilation and which ones influenced compilation? Have you ever analyzed a big plan and wish you could search for table name, index name or column name without opening XML plan? When you see a clustered index was used do you know for sure which statistics were used by the Query Optimizer to estimate the number of rows? 

In this demo intensive session, I will show you how to find and use new features introduced into SSMS and Showplan.  You will walk out of this session equipped to make Query Performance Troubleshooting easier and ready to tackle those nasty, hard to solve query plans.</p>

<h3>High Availability and Disaster Recovery for SQL Server in Azure IaaS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The CEO just tasked you with moving all the SQL Server instances to Azure, or maybe you are deploying a brand new application and want to leverage Azure IaaS to host SQL Server. Beyond security and performance, your most pressing concern might be ensuring SQL Server running in Azure is highly available.
 
While on-prem high availability and disaster recovery options for SQL Server are well defined, moving those instances to Azure immediately presents some questions and challenges. Can I simply lift and shift my SQL Server Failover Cluster Instance to the cloud? Do I need to upgrade to SQL Server Enterprise Edition and us Always On Availability Groups? What about shared storage and failover clustering? What about disaster recovery, what are my options there? Load Balancers, Fault Domains, Availability Zones, Azure Site Recovery and Region Pairs, what are these things and why do they matter to me?

<h3>PaaSport to Paradise: Lifting  Shifting with Azure SQL Database + SSIS in Azure Data Factory</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session focuses on the all PaaS solution of Azure SQL DB/Managed Instance (MI) + SSIS in Azure Data Factory (ADF) to lift  shift, modernize, and extend ETL workflows. We will first show you how to provision Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime (IR) – dedicated ADF servers for running SSIS – with SSIS catalog (SSISDB) hosted by Azure SQL DB/MI, configure it to access data on premises using Windows authentication and Virtual Network injection/Self-Hosted IR as a proxy, and extend it with custom/Open Source/3rd party components. We will also show you how to migrate SSIS packages + jobs using Data Migration Service and use the familiar SSDT/SSMS tools to manage them in the cloud just like you do on premises. We will next show you how to modernize your ETL workflows by invoking/scheduling SSIS package executions as first-class activities in ADF pipelines and combining/chaining them with other activities, allowing you to automatically (de)provision SSIS IR just in time, etc.</p>

<h3>Version control with GIT for the DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In 2005, Linus Torvalds developed the version control system (VCS) git. Since then, it has become as platform agnostic and ubiquitous as the internet. Microsoft has fully embraced Git. It powers modern on premise and cloud versions of TFS (now know as Azure Devops) as well GitHub, which Microsoft recently acquired. 

What does this mean to a DBA? Whether or not you use SSDT, you should be storing your database schema in version control. In addition, your utility scripts certainly belong in VCS. 

In my session. We'll cover:

Why should I store my schema in SSDT to help prevent developers from using code first ORMs.
What is version control?
How does a distributed version control system differ from traditional version control like Visual Sourcesafe, TFS, and SVN?
How do I setup git for internal use in my company?
How do I host public and private repositories on github.
How do pull requests work?
We will be covering using git from both the command line and Visual Studio.</p>

<h3>What is kusto query language?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As data professionals makes progress in their migration to cloud, we are learning new ways to monitor and alert on resources and services. Microsoft has consolidated many services under the umbrella ‘Azure Monitor’. One of the primary sources of monitoring is ‘Azure Monitor logs’ (which is also knows as Log Analytics). Azure Monitor logs are built on Azure Data Explorer which uses the Kusto query language. Going forward, the Kusto language should be your primary resource for querying the Azure Monitor log.  In this demo intensive session, I will show you some ‘getting started’ tips and a few sophisticated queries using Kusto.

<h3>Top Tips for Deploying AGs and FCIs On Premises or In the Cloud</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There are three main ways to deploy Always On Availability Groups (AGs) and Always On Failover Cluster Instances (FCIs) - physical hardware, virtualized, and IaaS in the public cloud. Starting with SQL Server 2017, we now also have the ability to use Windows Server or Linux. While some things are the same, each of the possible permutations and combinations affect how you plan, deploy, and administer AGs and FCIs. This session cuts right to the chase and will give you top tips and tricks for successfully deploying and administering AGs and FCIs so you can be an availaility hero no matter where you are deploying or what operating system you are using.</p>

<h3>Data Virtualization with PolyBase</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>PolyBase is Microsoft's data virtualization technology, allowing you to integrate SQL Server with external systems such as Hadoop and Azure Blob Storage.  As of SQL Server 2019, PolyBase also allows you to connect to diverse systems such as Oracle, MongoDB, Cosmos DB, Teradata, Apache Spark, and even other SQL Server instances.  In this talk, we will walk through the mechanics of PolyBase, showing how we can write T-SQL queries to access data from heterogeneous sources.  We will investigate the Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) and other resources needed to tease out what the PolyBase engine is doing behind the scenes and where to go when things break down.  Finally, we will look at several interesting use cases for PolyBase in the modern data environment.</p>

<h3>Approaching Zero:  Minimizing Downtime During Deployments</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Negotiating a downtime for a release can be difficult in this modern, 24x7 world.  When downtime means lost revenue, the price of taking a downtime to deploy code can run up quickly.  This talk will show you a way to reduce the cost of deployment by reducing or even eliminating required downtime for database code deployment.  We will show how to release new database code, update existing stored procedures, refactor and restructure tables, and even perform systemic re-architecture with no downtime and minimal blocking.  We will use as a case study one release in which we modified the primary key column on 180 tables and updated over 550 stored procedures without end users noticing a thing.  If you want to hit that three nines (or better) service-level agreement, this talk will help get you on the road to reduced downtime.</p>

<h3>I have indexes, but do I have the right indexes?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Do you have all the right indexes on your SQL Server databases?   Have you implemented any indexes other than traditional clustered and non-clustered indexes?  If the answer to either question is a “no” or an “I don’t know”, then this session is for you.

This session will help introduce less commonly used index types and settings along with indexing methodologies.  Follow along while we learn which indexes your SQL Server is begging you to make and others it wishes you would drop.  Learn use cases for filtered, full-text, and columnstore indexes.  There will be plenty of demos and shareable scripts to showcase the benefits too!

Are you using a version and edition of SQL Server is able to use these features?  We’ll cover that too and you’ll leave this class with a repeatable indexing methodology you can use to improve your database performance.</p>

<h3>Database DevOps with Visual Studio and Jenkins</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Are your database releases time-consuming, complicated, and exception-driven?  Do you wish you could deploy just a few of the changes from database 1 to database 2?  Does your boss say “we should do more of this DevOps stuff”?  Time to think about automation.

Keeping your “desired state” database in version control is the first step toward easy, repeatable deployments.  When your database contains exactly what it’s supposed to, there’s no such thing as “but it worked in Dev.”  And that’s just the beginning.

Join Larry Blake and Shantan Kallu from Teach for America to learn how they created custom Jenkins pipelines to automate deployments, run unit tests, introduce code review approval steps, manage logins, and more.  No Jenkins knowledge is assumed.</p>

<h3>How to automate row level security in Power BI using DAX and SSAS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Power BI is a business analytics solution that lets you visualize your data and share insights across your organization or embed them in your app or website. This session is for users are who want to automate Power BI row-level security by replicating the security of another data source such as corporate ERP. Many organizations maintain tight data security within their organization. Row-level security needs to be defined within Power BI. This can be difficult if you have many users and security changes happen quite often. If you are using a corporate ERP system that has security built into it, you would end up doing redundant work of managing security at two places, in ERP as well as in Power BI. DAX query can be used to filter out rows based on user ID/user name. We will go over the demo of the entire process starting from bringing data into SSAS, creating data model, applying row level security  publish the report. Never again you will have to manually manage roles within Power BI.</p>

To that end it is important to understand what makes for a good index as well as how to properly maintain indexes. In other words we need an indexing strategy.

In this session we will cover the following:

Heaps
Clustered vs non clustered indexes
How the optimizer determines what indexes to use – Statistics!
How to determine good indexes
How to implement proper index maintenance / Common strategies</p>

<p>The California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) has substantial implications on the data governance and data management practices of all companies that have customers in California.   The CCPA will come into effect in 2020 and has substantial potentially large monetary penalties for non-compliance.   Are you ready?   We will discuss what the CCPA is and who is required to comply with the law.   A presentation of MetaCenter, an enterprise metadata management and data governance solution,  will be given to show how a tool can be used to help you comply with the data inventory and data lineage requirements of the CCPA.</p>

<h3>Is Physical Still An Option for SQL Server Deployments?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With the push towards virtualization and the public cloud, are there people still deploying physical SQL Server architectures? The answer is yes. However, the answer should not always be yes. As we move towards an increasingly cloudy world, when does it make sense to deploy physical hardware? What do those solutions look like in 2019 since things have evolved quite a bit in the past few years with options like hyperconverged? This session will cover when you may want to consider - and when you probably don't want - physical solutions.</p>
