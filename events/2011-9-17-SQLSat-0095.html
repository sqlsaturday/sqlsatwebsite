<h3>Virtualizing your SQL Server Environments</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If you are a DBA, and you are hearing from your management team "Everything else is being virtualized, when can we virtualize your SQL Servers?", then you need to come to this session. In it we will discuss the concepts required to properly virtualize SQL Server. You can take control and lead the virtualization conversation by building a fact based plan for when to virtualize, and when to go with a physical infrastructure. You need ammunition and hard evidence to push the server and virtualization teams to consider your SQL Server environments in a different light. What metrics are important for you to capture before go live, and what metrics you must monitor proactively for success.

<h3>Problem Solving with Common Table Expressions</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Are you looking for an easier way to de-duplicate your data? Do you need to join a SELECT statement to itself six ways to Sunday? Common Table Expressions (CTEs) can make these tasks (and many others) so much more manageable, you'll wonder how you ever got along without them. CTEs are a very useful method for abstracting data access in most of the popular relational database platforms (MS SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, DB2). This session will walk through syntax and implementation of CTEs in MS SQL Server. We will then focus on their practical uses, including self-joins, taking advantage of windowing functions, removing duplicates from data sets, and recursion. </p>

<h3>Reducing the impact of database changes on an app</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The session is about domain driven development. It seems most ORM frameworks being out there do not really solve the abstraction problem between the two as these are table centric. Do such really follow SOA principles when it comes to treating the db? Empower your next project with... server side ORM. I will let you deeply rethink what you've done so far. My approach let me save days or weeks of otherwise wasted development hours when it comes to "make a change". You might feel ORM of your choice seem let you kickstart the project faster, but then... every major change and tweak here and there is a nightmare (refactor, recompile, retest, redeploy). Rewriting an app after every change is like working one step forward, two step backwards.</p>

<h3>10 Things all BI Administrators Should Know</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Conversations about SQL Server administration tends to be all about administering OLTP systems. If you administrate BI systems, you can't apply everything you know about administering OLTP systems to BI systems. BI systems usually end up being administered by OLTP DBAs or by BI developers and architects. Where does one even find a BI Administrator? Fortunately, I've been administering BI systems for several years, and I have learned the hard way the difference between administering OLTP and BI systems. This session will cover the top 10 things that I think an administrator of BI systems need to know.</p>

<h3>Replication Magic: Initializing From Backups</h3>

<h3>Understanding Parameter Sniffing</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Parameter sniffing is a good thing: it is used by the Query Optimizer to produce an execution plan tailored to the current parameters of a query. However, due to the way that the plan cache stores these plans in memory, sometimes can also be a performance problem. This session will show you how parameter sniffing works and in which cases could be a problem. How to diagnose and troubleshoot parameter sniffing problems and their solutions will be discussed as well. The session will also include details on how the Query Optimizer uses the histogram and density components of the statistics object and some other advanced topics.

<h3>Inside the SQL Server Query Optimizer</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The SQL Server Query Optimizer is a cost-based optimizer: it analyzes a number of candidate execution plans for a given query, estimates the cost of each of these plans, and selects the plan with the lowest cost. In this session I will go into the internals of the Query Optimizer and will show you the steps that it performs in the background covering everything from the time a query is submitted to SQL Server until an execution plan is generated. Why query optimization is an inherently complex problem and why challenges in some of its most fundamental areas are still being addressed today will be covered as well.

<p>These  are SQL tips for the YouTube generation.  I have 20 SQL Server performance tuning and developer tips.  They have little to do with each other, and we'll spend about five minutes on each.  Think of this as 20 different, five minute presentations.</p>

<h3>What is "Project Apollo"?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Project Apollo introduces Columnstore index in Denali. Columnstore
index can potentially improve data warehouse query performance on
large fact tables (star joins and aggregation) by creating a highly
compressed architecture. It utilizes the same vertipaq algorithm used
by Powerpivot.  Only the data for the columns selected in the query is
brought into memory. Columnstore index is recommended primarily for
read-only workloads.The demo will include scenarios which will benefit
from using columnstore index and will highlight best practices for
using columnstore index.</p>

<h3>SSIS in Denali</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session we will cover new features of SSIS in Denali in three main areas: the development experience, the deployment experience and the maintenance experience.  We will show the results of migrating an existing 2008 SSIS solution that uses package configurations, parent/child package execution and custom logging to Denali.  I will compare the new tools to 2008 and will also throw in useful tidbits of SSIS knowledge that I have. If you develop, deploy or maintain SSIS packages then you will take away something positive from the presentation</p>

<h3>So you want to be a BI Developer?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Are you just getting into Business Intelligence?  Are you a SQL Developer or a DBA that wants to learn more about the skills required to be a BI Professional?  If you answered yes to one of those questions, then this is the session for you.  This session will take you through the whole Microsoft stack and talk about some of the key areas of knowledge that are needed to call yourself a BI professional at either a beginner, intermediate or advanced level.  We will also talk about the various Microsoft Certifications and where they fit.  I guarantee you will leave this session with some to-dos and knowledge that you will want to brush up on.</p>
