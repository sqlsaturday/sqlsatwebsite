<h3>Avoid Slow SSAS Queries: MDX Query Troubleshooting</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Do you have SSAS queries that you feel should be faster? Multidimensional Expressions, or MDX, is the language used to work with Analysis Services. Similar to SQL for the relational engine, MDX is a language for queries and DDL statements on multidimensional cubes in Analysis Services. Troubleshooting slow MDX queries is often challenging because the level of support provided by the tools and the Analysis Services engine is not as mature as that found in the relational engine. This session covers the methods for examining slow queries using the SQL Profiler and Performance Monitor to determine the need for aggregations, caching problems, memory constraints, and so forth. Best practices for optimizing MDX will be examined.</p>

<h3>Database Design Fundamentals</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session I will give an overview of how to design a database, including the common normal forms and why they should matter to you if you are creating or modifying SQL Server databases. Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have proven for many years. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against the way data should be structured and can be avoided by applying the basic normalization techniques and are obvious things that you find yourself struggling with time and again (i.e. using the SUBSTRING function in a WHERE clause meaning you can't use an index efficiently). </p>

<h3>Comparing Clustering Methods for SQL Server </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Clustering is very important technology for High Availability and it is important for DBA to understand benefits and pitfalls. With very few available techniques and a lot of gray areas right decision might help to avoid extra costs. Presentation is unveiling clustering basics, reviews and compares clustering technologies including Microsoft, XCOTO Gridscale, and HP PolyserveMatrix. This presentation can be helpful not only to beginners but to intermediate level DBAs and infrastructure managers.</p>

<h3>Indexes and Other Free Performance Boosts</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The database is often viewed as a major performance bottleneck. There are a number of quick, easy, painless techniques that can increase the performance of an application not just by a small amount, but by orders of magnitude. These techniques includes simple indexing techniques, T-SQL techniques, and general database application design patterns that give great gains in performance. In this session, you will learn how to look at a database to identify these problem areas and how to resolve common issues that you will encounter.</p>

<h3>Do It Right: Best Practices for Analysis Services</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Are you seeking practical, in-depth technical advice for building a BI solution using SSAS? Analysis Services changed tremendously with the advent of SQL Server 2005. It introduced a new way of building dimensions and cubes that required a new way of modeling the solution. This session examines the best practices for properly designing cubes for performance and usability. It discusses some high-level topics but also looks at advanced topics such as alternative approaches to many-to-many dimensions, SCOPE statements, aggregation design, scalability issues, processing techniques, server properties, and more. </p>

<h3>Building a functional Data Mart with SSIS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) is incredibly powerful and provides a great foundation for building a high-quality data mart.  In this session learn tips and trick like how to incorporate unstructured data sources, successfully clean data, and build high-performing slowly-changing dimensions (without using a wizard!).  </p>

<h3>PowerPivot: Delivering Self-Serve BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If you are always looking for better ways to deliver value to the business as part of a BI project, make sure you examine the capabilities of PowerPivot. Using existing data and tools, users now have the ability to analyze vast quantities of data without first designing dimensions and measure groups. Users can explore the data and optionally share their analysis with others. See how Gemini opens the power of Analysis Services to non-technical users while still allowing the IT organization to administer and secure the data.</p>

<h3>Advanced TSQL Solutions </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The range of real-world queries that can be performed using set-based TSQL solutions is astounding, but many of these are not well known and if you haven't been shown the light you might never realize what is possible. Come and join me as we delve into the inner recesses and corners of the TSQL envelope using a wide variety of expressions, clauses and techniques. </p>

<h3>DMVs- What are they and why should a DBA care? </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>DMVs - Dynamic Management Views and Funcations are the DBA’s looking glass into the internals of SQL Server.  They will give a DBA a snapshot on how the database is performing and potential problem areas.  In this session, we will review a number of DMVs describing the types of information that can be captures and how it might be used.  This review will include index statistics, query performance, memory utilization to name a few.</p>

<h3>Gather SQL Server Performance Data with PowerShell</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>We all know how important it is to keep a baseline of performance metrics that allow us to know when something is wrong and help us to track it down and fix the problem.  We don't always know how to do this easily and consistently.  This session will walk you through a series of PowerShell scripts you can schedule which will capture the most important data and a set of reports to show you how to use that data to keep your server running smoothly.</p>

<h3>Database Design Patterns </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Beyond database design fundamentals (for example, Normalization) lies the area where you have to create "real" solutions. In this session, I will cover a good number of patterns that we commonly find useful to try to apply to the problem of building a database solution. Ideas like generalization, subclassing, single table domain tables, optional data, and more will be discussed, some of them good, some not so good (don't assume which will be which), but all that are common and/or useful for your database implementations.</p>

<h3>Programming with FileStream Object</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server 2008 introduced the FileStream object.  This allowed developers to resolve an age long dilemma of storing large binary files in the database or accessing them on the file system.  SS08 provides the best of both worlds while allowing applications to access the data readily through the FileStream object via Transact SQL or File I/O.</p>

<h3>A Dynamic World Demands Dynamic SQL</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Dynamic SQL is a misunderstood and much maligned part of a DBA’s tool kit – it can be used to solve difficult business problems, respond to diverse data needs, and alleviate performance problems. Many DBAs reject dynamic SQL outright as a potential source of SQL injections, being poorly performing, or just for being a hacky solution in general. Not so! Jeremiah Peschka has been making extensive use of dynamic SQL throughout his career to solve a variety of problems. He’ll set about dispelling these misconceptions and demonstrate how dynamic SQL can become a part of every DBA’s tool kit.</p>

<h3>XQuery Basics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With the introduction of the XML data type in SQL Server 2005 a new level of flexibility has been introduced to relational database environments to support loosely structured data.  To get that data back requires an understanding of XQuery, the powerful query language written for XML specifically.  This session will cover the basics of XQuery and help you get up to speed on this new environment.</p>

Brent will be running around with scissors, doing all kinds of oddball T-SQL stunts that have no business in the business world.  If you're the kind of person who loves using a number after the GO statement (like GO 10), then you'll love this session.</p>

<h3>Performance Tuning for Race Car Drivers</h3>

<p>Times are tough even for the best drivers: Helio Castroneves is dancing for money and Danica Patrick is doing ads for what appears to be an adult services company.  Maybe it’s time to switch careers, and Brent has just the thing.  Use your hard-earned knowledge of high speeds, million-dollar hardware and surviving disastrous crashes to become a SQL Server performance tuner!
