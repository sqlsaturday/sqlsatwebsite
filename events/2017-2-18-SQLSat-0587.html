<h3>Query Store: A (R)evolution in Query Tuning</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Fixing performance problems and detecting query regressions has never been easy in SQL Server as the database engine fundamentally does not capture the relevant information. With the release of SQL Server 2016, Microsoft has introduced a feature called Query Store that will help you capture vital query metrics that will help performance troubleshooting and regression detection. In this session we will examine Query Store and how it can be used in a myriad of use cases. We will examine its architecture, configuration and shortcomings. This session will help you build a monitoring solution that will help you detect and solve real-world performance problems across your entire SQL Server infrastructure. It will also substantially help de-risk upgrade projects, so there's no "excuse" not to upgrade to SQL Server 2016!</p>

<h3>Power Query is more than just a desktop BI ETL tool</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Power Query is a relatively new addition to Microsoft Excel that brings ETL to the self service BI user's desktop.  In this level 200 session I cover the basics of Power Query and how it can be used for desktop BI before quickly moving on to demonstrate how you can use Power Query for more advanced scenarios that you may not have thought of before, including:
	• Use Power Query as a data provider for traditional Excel Pivot Tables without using Power Pivot.
	• Building a Power Pivot calendar table from scratch using pure Power Query steps.
	• Add commentary to bank statements and make those comments "stick" using self-referencing tables.
	• Using Power Query as an auditing and exception management
        • Using Power Query as a pure ETL tool and exporting more than 1 m rows of transformed data to a file.</p>

<h3>DevOPs and the DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You may have heard the word "DevOps" and wondered whether it is just another buzzword and/or what it can do for you.
In this session I will demystify the concepts of DevOps and we will look at two aspects of DevOps - Continuous Integration  Continuous Delivery.

Continuous Integration is the practice in which software developers frequently integrate their work with that of other members of the development team.It also involves automating tests around the integrated work

​Continuous Delivery is the next step after Continuous Integration in the deployment pipeline and is the process of automating the deployment of software to  test, staging, and production environments.

Database migrations/changes are an area that may not be typically automated or utilise Continuous Delivery.

Through the use of a comprehensive live demo to a running production database the audience will learn the benefits and how to implement Continuous Delivery in their database systems deployment pipeline.</p>

<h3>A Rocket Scientist View on Indexes</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Indexes can be a boon or decrement for query performance. This presentation will present what they are (in layman’s terms) and how they may affect query performance – both from a read (SELECT) viewpoint as well as a data modification aspect (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).  This session will concentrate with a deep dive into clustered indexes and nonclustered indexes, their syntax and utilization, and their effect on performance in transaction and data warehouse databases.  Covering nonclustered indexes will also be examined in detail and the scenarios they should be applied.  There will be many query demos illustrating index utilization using statistics and query plans.  Attendee should have some TSQL and Management Studio experience.</p>

<h3>Handling Relationships in DAX</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The Tabular model in Power Pivot for Excel, Power BI and SSAS Tabular seems to offer only plain-vanilla one-to-many relationships, based on a single column. In 2015 there was the introduction of many-to-many relationships, yet the model seems somewhat poor when compared with SSAS Multidimensional. In reality, by leveraging the DAX language, you can handle virtually any kind of relationship, no matter how complex they are. In this session we will analyze and solve several scenarios with calculated relationships, virtual relationships, complex many-to-many. The goal of the session is to show how to solve complex scenarios with the aid of the DAX language to build unconventional data models.</p>

<h3>Power BI Governance and Enterprise-wide Deployment Options</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Since release of Power BI many companies have started using it to leverage their data assets to profit from market opportunities. The ease of use and quick time-to-value were main elements to make Power BI a respected tool for every business from small to large enterprise. Many Business Users started using Power BI with minimum / no IT collaboration that started causing concerns especially within larger organisations. Now organisations have become increasingly aware of the need to put a governance and control process in place. 

In this presentation Iman will use his experience in implementing and rolling out Power BI for numerous organisations to share some tips and options for governance and deployment approaches at enterprise level.</p>

<h3>In memory OLTP - what can it do for me?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In Memory OLTP came along in SQL Server 2014 along with several limitations.
It was still really useful – as long as your use case suited the limitations.
SQL Server 2016 removes several of these limitations and widens the use cases of in-memory OLTP.
For example, even if you are not taking advantage of in-memory tables, you can probably leverage performance improvements by replacing traditional table variables and both local and global temporary tables with in memory implementations. Now you’ll be able to say that table variable is truly in memory!
Come along to this session and learn about some of features of in memory OLTP  - or Hekaton as a lot of people refer to this -  and how you may be able to leverage these high performance features in both new and existing applications.</p>

<h3>How to Use Parameters Like a Pro and Boost Performance</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Parameters are a fundamental part of T-SQL programming, whether they are used in stored procedures, in dynamic statements or in ad-hoc queries. Although widely used, most people aren’t aware of the crucial influence they have on query performance. In fact, wrong use of parameters is one of the common reasons for poor application performance.
Does your query sometimes run fast and sometimes slow – even when nothing’s changed? Did it happen to you that a stored procedure, which had always been running for less than a second, suddenly started to run for more than 5 seconds consistently – even when nothing had changed?
In this session we will learn about plan caching and how the query optimizer handles parameters. We will talk about the pros and cons of parameter sniffing (don’t worry if you don’t know what that means) as well as about simple vs. forced parameterization. But most important – we will learn how to identify performance problems caused by poor parameter handling, and we will</p>

<h3>Plan, Design and Implement a HADR Solution - a Journey</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever struggled to get a HA and DR solution for a single instance with more than 50 applications, 100 databases and 4 TB of data? 
Over the years, HA and DR has been a challenge with SQL Server. As the product evolved so did the options simplified for achieving a feasible HADR solution.
In this session I will walk you through various projects I have worked on in past 8 years. 
I will start with the basic DR solution built using Log shipping, an alternate to AGs in SQL 2008 using Powershell/.NET and SAN Replication and the latest 4 node, two site cluster built with Availability Groups.</p>
