<h3>SQL Server Internals:  It's What's for Dinner!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Ever wondered what happens under the hood when you query your SQL Server database? Well, it’s somewhat like asking for a special meal for dinner. During this session, I will use a cooking analogy to describe the life cycle of a query and the journey it takes through SQL Server’s working parts. By comparing the concepts of SQL Internals to a familiar idea, you will have a clear understanding of the underlying processes involved in returning data from a SELECT query. Once we’ve established a frame of reference for a simple read operation, we’ll look at an UPDATE statement and consider the additional factors associated with a write operation.  By session's end you should have a clear overview of what happens when a query hits your server.</p>

<h3>T-SQL Brush-up:The Best Things You Forgot You Knew</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You’re a good SQL professional – you attend conferences and webinars, you read articles and books, and you know your way around SQL Server. But sometimes – just SOMEtimes – some piece of T-SQL slips by you unnoticed, or falls out of memory. Most of us are working with at least two or three out of the last five versions of SQL Server, so who can blame us for missing a feature or two? Come and revisit old favorites, and brush up on new T-SQL features and enhancements. In this session you will see SELECT turned inside-out. You’ll get really, really excited about OVER and PARTITION BY. You’ll learn that Common Table Expressions are, in fact, very cool. This session is chock full of code examples, including before-and-after demos and how-tos.</p>

<h3>Unraveling Tangled Code – A Spellbinding Tale</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Once upon a time, you inherited an application or a database that was filled with chaos and inconsistencies. The T-SQL code is overly complex and impossible to ken. The architecture is painful to behold, and grueling to code for. One might optimistically say that query performance is “spectacularly mediocre”. If you’re without good documentation or system architects to guide you, how do you break the curse of confusion? In this session you’ll learn several methods for conquering chaotic code, and how to seek and destroy some of the nastier coding mistakes and inefficiencies. We will break complicated queries into key pieces, turn them upside-down, and reform them into something sensible. We will emerge victorious!</p>

<h3>Parent/Child Structures in SSIS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server Integration Services provides the ability to nest packages within one another in a parent/child structure.  By creating a multilayer package infrastructure using native elements of SSIS, you can easily encapsulate reusable components of your ETL layer, simplify logging, and make the development process more efficient.

In this session, we'll take a tour through the parent/child facilities within SSIS, including the following:

-- Benefits of using parent/child structures
-- Sharing values between parent and child packages
-- Parent/child logging
-- Dynamic child packages
-- Changes in the Execute Package Task from SQL 2008 to SQL 2012

We'll also walk through some practical examples of parent/child package implementatio</p>

<h3>Knowledge from Data–FileTable and Semantic Search</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If you thought the data in your database was growing fast, just try to figure out your unstructured data.  More and more knowledge is being generated in blog posts, tweets, web pages, and various other documents inside and outside of your organization.  Gathering all of this data into a usable repository is a difficult task to start with; making sense of all of the information and being able to find what you are looking for are in a whole other league.  Two new features in SQL Server 2012 make this daunting task more manageable.  We’ll cover how to leverage the FileTable feature to manage the storage of your unstructured data and then how to apply Full-Text Indexing with the new semantic search capabilities to find what you are looking for.</p>

<h3>Inside the SQL Server Query Optimizer</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The SQL Server Query Optimizer is a cost-based optimizer: it analyzes a number of candidate execution plans for a given query, estimates the cost of each of these plans, and selects the plan with the lowest cost. In this session I will go into the internals of the Query Optimizer and will show you the steps that it performs in the background covering everything from the time a query is submitted to SQL Server until an execution plan is generated. Why query optimization is an inherently complex problem and why challenges in some of its most fundamental areas are still being addressed today will be covered as well.</p>

<h3>Standardize Your Environment With Best Practices</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Are all your servers standardized across your environment? Do you manually click the next button when installing 
SQL Server? Do you manually create and configuring your routine maintenance? Are your SQL Agent Jobs owned by 
other DBAs in your group? Do you know when jobs fail? Or discover them accidentally? Do you have a standardized 
way to deploy updates?

We will discuss all these things and some others during this session and hopefully when we come out the other 
side some of this will make your life easier.</p>

<h3>You Inherited a Database, Now What?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You have recently inherited the support of a new or existing database, what are the things you should immediately check and start monitoring and what are the things that you should address over the next few weeks. When taking over support of a database or system, you cannot ASSUME anything. At the end of this session you will have a nice checklist of things you should check and be doing on ALL your databases not just the one you inherited. Whether you are a seasoned DBA or just starting out, this session should be informative and something you can relate to. </p>

<h3>SQL Server Security for Developers</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server has a robust and granular system for granting and denying access to users, but all too often we see applications running as DBO or even sysadmin. Why? Part of is that same granular system can be overwhelming and part is that many developers don't see the point in applying such granular security. In this introductory level presentation we'll start at the beginning with creating and managing logins, take a quick look at system roles, and then get into the nitty gritty of users and roles and permissions at the database level. Along the way we'll talk about why its so important to set security at the database and not just rely on the application enforced security.</p>

<p>Are you confident that your application performs as expected on Leap Day?  Do you know how long it would take to run out of identity values in your major tables?  Can you support case-sensitive collations and non-standard sort orders?  If not, odds are good that you are not edge and corner testing your application.  In this session, learn how to define the edges of your application and start to stretch those boundaries by setting up challenging test and development environments.  For database administrators, learn what configurations in your environment may be a source of bugs in application code and what you can do about it.  Learn about edge cases that you can start hardening your code against on Monday morning!</p>

<h3>Building Your Own SQL Server Virtual Playground</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As the number of SQL Server versions and features grow over time so does the the difficulty in maintaining a set of tools for working with all of them on your local machine. Add in that some features require multiple physical instances and suddenly a single installation isn't enough. Need to quickly switch between versions and editions of SQL Server? Want to learn how to set up a cluster? Or maybe you want to try out the latest features in SQL 2012...virtualization offers a convenient way to do any or all of these. In this session we'll show you how by covering the fundamentals of desktop virtualization and demonstrating how to set up a virtual playground on your own machine.</p>

<h3>Many-to-Many: Multiple Calendars in a Single Cube</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Including the fiscal calendars of major customers within the date dimensions of their own cubes has great appeal to many organizations, including financial services firms and the like. After all, having customer calendars in their cubes' date dimension means sales and marketing managers can analyze - and report upon - data according to the fiscal calendar of the customer, as well as within the context of their own. In this session, Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson leads an examination into a way we can accomplish this by implementing a SQL Server Analysis Services "many-to-many" dimension scenario.

<h3>AlwaysOn - Finally, A usable 'mirror'!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In the past, High Availability and Disaster Recovery (HADR) had many limitations. Clustering and Mirroring are great, but the mirror/secondary database is not very usable since it is not online.  Finally, AlwaysOn solves this limitation by merging both multi-node Clustering and mirroring. Denali AlwaysOn also allows the secondary database to remain ONLINE, so we can use it for reporting purposes without resorting to a Snapshot!  Come see this lively session with extensive demos of setting up, configuring and testing AlwaysOn. We'll also test automatic ConnectionString fail-over using a real web app to see how well that feature works.</p>

<h3>Beginning Powershell for DBAs 1.0</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The time has come where DBAs can no longer afford to ignore powershell. Not only has it become an integral part of SQL Server, but we’re being asked to do things on a much grander scale than ever before; things that can only be done with powershell. This session will take you from nothing and explain what powershell is all about. I’m going to show you how the more things change the more they stay the same and if you master the basics of powershell in this session, you’ll be able to work with powershell not only in SQL Server, but also at the file system level, in Exchange, IIS, Windows, and anything else. So in this session I’m going to show you the basics you need to get your powershell career started.</p>

<h3>A Comparison of SQL Server and Oracle</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Today, more often than not, an organization runs on both SQL Server and Oracle databases.
 
Both SQL Server and Oracle often implement comparible features, backup recovery, high availability, security etc.
It makes sense for DBAs to be familiar with the best practice concepts, armed with knowledge of the both worlds.

In this session, I will present SQL Server and Oracle side-by-side for a comparison of similarity and differences on most popular and useful aspects.

<h3>Eating the Elephant: SQL Server Table Partitioning</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Is your table fat? Do you need to manage a table that has billions of rows within it and are overwhelmed by index rebuilds that take more than 12 hours? SQL Server's table partitioning gives the DBA the tools to manage this beast and support very large tables in a way where index management and data retrieval does not become unwieldy. This presentation will take you step by step through choosing an appropriate partitioning key, setting up the partitioning on the table, and finally maintaining the partitions.

<h3>Working With XML In SQL Server </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>XML is a technology that Developers and DBAs alike share a love-hate relationship with; it's powerful and flexible yet it can be bloated and difficult to work with at the same time. Regardless, XML has found a home in many applications - including SQL Server (e.g. execution plans) - so it's important to understand how to work with it in your databases. This session will show you how to use the XML data type, perform basic operations on XML data, and how to use FOR XML to create XML from relational data. This isn't a session to convince you to use XML, but to show you what you can do with XML when you do need to use it!

<h3>It is TEMPDB, Why Should You Care?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>TEMPDB is just for temporary data right? It is installed by default and gets recreated it time SQL is restarted so what does it matter right? WRONG. This session will give you great insight into what uses TEMPDB, why TEMPDB is important, what are some best practices for configuring TEMPDB, and how to determine if you have contention. If you have systems where TEMPDB hasn't been touched since the install, you need to attend this session. </p>

<h3>Introduction to the XML source</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>XML is all over the place.  But how do you get that data into SQL Server?  SSIS provides an XML Source, but it is not easy to use.  In this session we will handle increasingly complex XML documents.  After an introduction to using the XML Source with a single set of elements, we will look at how to work with multiple element sets.  This includes hierarchically structured XML documents.

Attendees will be able to import simple XML using SSIS.  They will be able to create import routines that pull data from different elements of more complex XML.  They will understand the role the XML Schema plays in defining the XML data they import.

<h3>SQL Server Amnesia</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Losing your memory is never fun. Well, I can't help you with that, but I can help show you how SQL Server is using its memory and some things to look for with regards to performance problems.

When I started as a DBA I didn't know much about SQL Server internals. I inherited quite a few servers and they were experiencing performance problems. Over time I learned more about the internals and how to troubleshoot systems. I'll share some stories with you and talk about some of the methods I use to look at how SQL Server is using its memory. Then we'll look at some examples and demo code.</p>

Functions like FREETEXTTABLE and CONTAINSTABLE open up some pretty groovy doors in terms of usability.  We’ll discuss ways to give your users that search engine like interface that everyone has grown accustomed to without sacrificing query performance.  We’ll also hit on creating synonyms to give your users results even when they aren’t quite sure what to search for.  It’s an entirely different type of search altogether.  </p>

<h3>Replication Magic: Initializing From Backups</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If you work with very large databases (VLDBs) that must be replicated, you should be using initialization from backup. There are a some misconceptions the have caused DBAs to assume that they could not use initialization from backup. In this session I will explore those misconceptions and prove that they are incorrect.

Demos will include initializing a subscriber from a transaction log backup and performing a partial restore of a database and initializing the subscriber from the partial backup.</p>
