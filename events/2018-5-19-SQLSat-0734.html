<h3>Disaster recovery is everyone's job!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Targeted at the non-DBA such as BI/DW folks, Application Developers, Managers, and System Admins, this session will go over the reasons we back up our databases, our systems, etc.  Considerations such as Single points of failure, High Availability/Disaster recovery, Business Continuity and others will be discussed in this interactive conversation.   It will be conversation heavy, with supporting slides to download, and one Database backup demo at the end if time permits.

Everyone involved in a technical role needs to at least know that the things they have created will be recoverable in the event of a disaster, or even just an "oops" moment.   The CIO/CTO should know how long critical systems will be down when bad things happen.  Backups are everyone's responsibility...whether asking the right questions or implementing the process.</p>

<h3>Getting your DB schema under control with SSDT</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you struggled with keeping track of all of the scripts needed to release the next version of your database? Have you ever had to scramble at the last minute due to bad database scripts? This session might help you get control of your database schema by using SQL Server Data Tools.

We'll cover:
* What exactly is SSDT?
* Getting your database into an SSDT project
* Putting that project into source control
* Making changes to the project through schema compares or direct changes
* Pushing those changes out to your servers

This session assumes basic knowledge of TSQL to create and manipulate database objects. Some understanding of Visual Studio, version control, and SQLCMD will help, but is not essential.</p>

<h3>Beginning Admin: The Care and Feeding of SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Design and development may be exciting, but database administration is absolutely critical (and, reasonably well-paying!) The care and feeding of a server tends to get short-changed or neglected.  In this class, we'll cover the basics of the big five administrator tasks:

* Backups – You must set up regular backups, to keep copies of your databases...just in case something breaks, or someone makes a bad, bad mistake.
* Integrity checks – Regularly and automatically check databases for corruption, which is when bits get scrambled, lost, and ruined.
* Index maintenance – Databases need regular upkeep so they'll continue to run well.
* Disk management – It's actually your job to find out about full disks before they happen. After all, databases grow!
* Alerting – Alerts tell you what's wrong, so you don't have to go looking for problems.

Being a database administrator is a big job, but we can cover the basics in one session!</p>

<h3>AlwaysOn on 2012/2014/2016/2017 Notes from the field and Best Practice</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>CIOs and VPs everywhere are asking me, how do we achieve HA with SQL Server? Having architected and implemented over 100 architectures, see how to architect, design, setup, deploy, tons of gotchas and best practices from real production deployments With the introduction of AlwaysOn and the deprecation of Database Mirroring, Windows Clustering Services is now more critical than ever. If you have moved away from clustering or implemented database mirroring as an alternative to clustering and found it lacking AlwaysOn is the way forward for you. This talk will demonstrate a complete end-to-end solution using Windows Server Failover Clustering, AlwaysOn, SQL Server 2017 Enterprise edition, and Active Directory.</p>

<h3>Dynamic SQL: Tables, Pivots, Parameters  More</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Dynamic SQL is a scripting language that helps you design flexibility into your code. It allows you to design solutions, pass parameters and allows you build a single query on values passed.  Dynamic SQL has both pros and cons to it's design, but can also be a helpful tool. This presentation will walk through the steps of building dynamic tables, aggregating data in a pivot format and give you the first steps of writing a Dynamic Query.  We will also see how to use Dynamic SQL to build multiple databases across servers, alter a single table in multiple servers and add columns to a table, all through the magic of Dynamic SQL.</p>

<h3>How to transition from Profiler to Extended Events and why you should consider.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Let me ask you, what comes to your mind when you hear / read phrase SQL Server Extended Events? You may be thinking: "What is it, what does it do?", "I don’t have time to learn this", "I already have the tool that does all I need", "It’ll require too much coding", "There is no way Extended Events can do what SQL Profiler does."
Why don’t we take a closer look using straightforward examples in order to figure out what it’s all about, because learning Extended Events is fun and easy.

In this session we will cover the following:
-- How to create an extended event session using an existing trace.
-- How to create XE (Extended Events) in UI (User interface) from the ground up.
-- How to analyze the data.
-- What to watch out for in terms of performance.</p>

<h3>Security, Hypocrisy, and Standards, "OH MY" or How to hack your data center in three easy steps.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>How secure do you think your data is? Why is everyone trying to get your data? How do you get a Comptroller of a large bearing supplier to be your puppet and do things they would never do? Hacking....Hacking....And more hacking. An introduction to situational awareness, on premise security, and social engineering. Learn the secrets of a pen tester and how they get your data. (Answer: it's Usually not through SQL Server.) Trust no one and ummmm always keep your protractor ready. (See Paranoia Role-playing Game). The chances are you've already been hacked and you don't even know it. Take a humorous journey through the eyes of an everyday DBA who sizes up weaknesses using tried and true Red Team hacking techniques. Lets face it. The data is where the money is. It's not in the snazzy new middle-ware that Bob the programmer is so proud of. It's in your data and sometimes your co-worker is your worst enemy. Remember never blame your self, always always blame the PROGRAMMER. It's Bob's fault!</p>

<h3>Database Project Makes Deployment Consistent</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The deployment process is frustrating; an object is missing, an object is deployed in the wrong order or an incorrect version. Deploying to multiple environments like Dev, QA, UAT, and Prod is a challenge whether on-premise or in the cloud. Source controlling database objects is paramount. Team development is required. Database code will only be deployed when changed. Proper security deployment will be repeatable per environment. Together, let us discover how using Database Project will help us with consistent releases. Deployments can cause you trouble but we will share a reliable deployment and version control process. Let’s see how Database Project can help us accomplish this goal.</p>

<h3>Introduction to Biml</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever needed to generate dozens (or even hundreds) of similar SSIS packages? Do you ever find yourself needing to regenerate a lot of packages when some piece of the upstream data format changes? Using native SSIS, this can be a tedious and error prone exercise. However, using Biml (Business Intelligence Markup Language) can greatly increase your productivity as an ETL developer.

In this session, we'll cover the essentials of Biml. I'll discuss what it is and what it can do for SSIS, demonstrating how it can easily generate dozens or even hundreds of packages in just a few minutes. I'll also demonstrate some realistic examples and discuss how Biml fits into the enterprise ETL picture.</p>

<h3>Azure Data Factory V2 and SSIS Automation With Biml</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SSIS was originally designed to work in a world where all data was structured and on premise. As modern enterprise data projects increasingly move online, tools like Azure Data Factory (ADF) can extend SSIS capabilities to the cloud. Azure Data Factory is a flexible and powerful cloud based ETL service, but it doesn't replace the functionality of SSIS. 

In this session you will learn the advantages and disadvantages of both ETL platforms; how to use both in tandem to maximize productivity; and how both ETL platforms, as well as any supporting structures, can be be automatically generated with Biml Script. 

All of the code used in this presentation can be downloaded by attendees, customized, and used in their production environments.</p>

<h3>Are There Time Bombs in your SSIS Packages?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Could your seemingly-normal SSIS package be hiding a disaster, waiting to detonate at the most inconvenient time? Integration Services is an incredibly flexible product, and that flexibility can lead to good - and occasionally bad - design patterns. Small and seemingly trivial design decisions can lead to big issues down the road, including leaky data flows, data quality issues, paralyzing performance issues, and other explosive behaviors.

In this session, we will explore some of the most common SSIS design patterns that are potentially more harmful than they first appear. From package configuration to control flow constraints, and data flow transformations to logging, we'll demonstrate what can go wrong and show some alternative designs to prevent these types of problems from developing into bigger issues.</p>

<h3>Automating Azure Analysis Services</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The elasticity of the cloud lets you provide a better user experience instead of breaking the bank running your solution at the highest scale 24 hours a day. This demo-heavy session will show how to automate Azure Analysis Services. We will look at solutions to the following questions: How do you schedule a refresh of the data in your Azure Analysis Services model? How do you pause the server on the weekends? Better yet, how can you pause it when the last user disconnects and start it automatically when the first user connects in the morning? How do you scale to meet peak demand each day? How can Azure Analysis Services load balance across servers in multiple countries so that the user connects to the geographically closest server? How do you extend your on-premises SSAS solution into Azure Analysis Services?</p>

<h3>Should This Be Normalized? When Database Normalization Seems Abnormal</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Ever since database normalization was introduced as a concept by Edgar Codd, there has been continuous debate on how far we should go to eliminate data redundancy. A new developer may be asking why there is a need to create multiple tables, and a DBA may be concerned that performance is being sacrificed. In this semi-interactive talk, we’ll discuss 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and Boyce-Codd Normal Forms, evaluate the pros and cons of normalization and denormalization for integrity and performance, and run through some demos involving scenarios of various data model formats. All to answer the question, "should...this...be...normalized?"</p>

<h3>The Life Cycle of a Query in Virtual Reality</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>How would you like to learn about using Virtual Reality (VR) to present information? The ability to become immersed and walk around inside of a VR environment is a new and unique way to present and look at information. As data professionals we need to be open to novel displays of data and explore what VR can do that for us that we have not been able to do in the past. VR can provide a way for people to see relationships and interact among data sets which can be difficult for computers to display visually on a flat screen.

The Life Cycle of a Query in Virtual Reality is built using Epic Games video game engine called Unreal Engine 4 (UE4). With native support for VR, UE4 has been used for applications beyond just video games. With the commercial availability of affordable VR headsets, data professionals can now create visually compelling environments that were almost impossible or extremely expensive just a few years ago on both PC and mobile devices.</p>

<h3>Why Should I Care About ... Partitioned Views?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Partitioned tables are awesome and partitioned views are dead, right? Well, sure partitioned views are not sexy but there are still plenty of applications where they are critical. And not necessarily just for standard edition who aren't on the new service pack yet. If your data is time stamped, do you see different queries run against older data than new data? Do you with you could segment your data across multiple columns? Do you have data you need to partition horizontally? It's possible partitioned views may still be for you. Come hear why this is still an important topic long after cargo pants and trucker hats went away ... and possibly even after 2016 SP1.</p>

<h3>That's bad mkay!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>We've all heard that things like nested views, cursors, and under/over-indexed tables are bad...but why?  What is the real cost of the badness that abounds in the database world?  What's really going on when you run that query against a view of a view of a view.  How can you quantify what happens when that cursor ends up running the same simple query thousands of times.  And how can indexes really impact the way SQL Server decides to solve your queries.  In this session we'll talk about the basics of how to read query plans and use extended events to understand why all these things can be big resource drains on a SQL Server.  Good times should be had by all.</p>
