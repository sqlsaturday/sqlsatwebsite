<h3>Characteristics of a Great Relational Database</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When queried, most database professionals would mention normalized as one of the most important characteristics that tell the difference between a good and bad relational database design (whether they know what the term "normalized" means or not.) Normalization is a key to great relational designs, but there is so much more to be considered. A normalized database that suffers from poor naming, too many or too few indexes, terrible interfaces, and so on can derail your design's value to the user.  In this session I will present primary characteristics of a design that differentiates between an ugly design that will have your colleagues nitpicking you to death and one that will have them singing your praises. Characteristics such as comprehendible, documented, secure, well performing, and more (including normalized, naturally) will be discussed.</p>

<h3>The Art of War with Bad Code</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Let’s face it, many of us are at war with poorly written or poorly tuned queries and processes. A typical DBA supports dozens to hundreds or even thousands of end users and processes. There is simply no way to manually determine what code is causing the most performance problems and now you don’t have to. We will see several straightforward techniques to positively identify the main culprits and allow you to prioritize your efforts in tuning them to give you the biggest ROI for your time. We will show how you can use simplified Extended Event traces and standard TSQL to quickly process the data so you can generate meaningful and actionable reports. The demo code can be integrated immediately into your own environment. Stop running in circles and start identifying the top offenders.
•	Learn how to properly capture the data used to identify the poor performers
•	Learn how to analyze data in order to pinpoint the top offenders
•	Understand how correlate this data to your environment</p>

<h3>Using Powershell to Document SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Most DBAs use multiple native and third party tools to fully document SQL Server instances yet still dont get all the objects. Even using Visual Studio and Database Projects, not all objects are exported because they live at the server level, above the database. Using Powershell, we will script out an organized set of files that can be checked into any Source Control system and or used for Disaster Recovery purposes. Objects exported include: SQL Agent Jobs/Alerts/Schedules, NT Service Credentials, SSIS-MSDB, SSIS-Catalog, SSAS Cubes, SSRS Reports, Logins, Server Configs, Linked Servers, DB Mail Operators/Accounts, Server Triggers and much more</p>

<h3>Practical Monitoring of TempDB</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>While TempDB make look like any other database it’s usage patterns are typically unique and require a special type of monitoring to stay ahead of any potential performance or space issues. This session is packed with demo’s that will outline what aspects of TempDB you need to pay attention to and exactly how to monitor for them. We will discuss what you can do to tune this database to match your workload and allow for proper scaling over time and different work patterns you may encounter. If you want peak performance from your SQL Serve Instance you need to ensure TempDB is up to the challenge. Come see exactly what those challenges are and what you can do to be ready for them.</p>

<h3>Monitoring with Extended Events</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Every good enterprising DBA has the prime directive of monitoring the SQL Servers under his/her jurisdiction. The last thing a DBA wants to hear is that there is a problem with a database under his/her purview from an end-user. 

SQL Server has progressed over time to give better and better information to the DBA. Much of this information can be used in a home grown solution to monitor SQL Server. With the constant increase in surface area from Extended Events, the power to build a home grown solution becomes more and more feasible while being limited only by the imagination of the enterprising DBA (or developer or data professional). 

You will be exposed to advanced troubleshooting techniques as we work through complex issues that are made easier through the use of XE. Take advantage of this opportunity to dive into the world of Extended Events and learn how you can make best use of this tool in your SQL 2008+ environment.</p>

<h3>Database Design Fundamentals</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have been proven for many years, but are often thought of as old-fashioned. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against these standards and can be avoided by understanding the requirements, applying normalization, as well as a healthy dose of simple common sense. In this session I will give an overview of how to design a relational database, allowing you to work with the data structures instead of against them. This will let you use SQL naturally, enabling the query engine internals to optimize your output needs without you needing to spend a lot of time thinking about it. This will mean less time trying to figure out why SUBSTRING(column,3,1) = 'A' is killing your performance, and more time for solving the next customer problem.</p>

<h3>Using Open Source Products to Collect Performance Metrics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Ever had a manager standing over your shoulder, wanting to know why an instance is running slow or if it can handle additional workload? What information would you use to answer these questions? If only you knew what performance metrics to collect and had them for your existing instances to answer these questions.

In this session, we will discuss sp_whoisactive and Query Store. Then we will be combining three open source tools – Telegraf, InfluxDB, and Grafana – into an inexpensive system that collects performance metrics you can use to troubleshoot issues and answer important questions about your SQL Server instances, including your Linux SQL Server instances. We will learn what metrics to collect, how to use the tools to collect performance metrics and then we’ll put it all together in an interactive dashboard for easy visualization.

Attendees will see how easy it is to get good performance data and visualize in an interactive way and combine with other tools to troubleshoot issue</p>

<h3>Encrypting Data within Sql Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data breaches abound! Do you want to keep off of the data breach list? What are some of the data privacy laws affecting you? How will encrypting data affect your database performance? What data fields should you encrypt?  What else can you do to protect your sensitive data?

In this session, we will review each option to encrypt data within SQL Server, Transparent Data Encryption, Cell Level Encryption and Always Encrypted. The session will deep dive into setting up Always Encrypted encryption and share my experiences implementing the encryption. In addition, the session will review auditing of sensitive data usage.  

You will leave the session with a deeper understanding about SQL Server encryption options and how encryption can affect your performance.  In addition, you will gather information on how to fully protect and review your sensitive data usage.</p>

<h3>Beginning Admin: The Care and Feeding of SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Design and development may be exciting, but database administration is absolutely critical (and, reasonably well-paying!) The care and feeding of a server tends to get short-changed or neglected.  In this class, we'll cover the basics of the big five administrator tasks:

* Backups – You must set up regular backups, to keep copies of your databases...just in case something breaks, or someone makes a bad, bad mistake.
* Integrity checks – Regularly and automatically check databases for corruption, which is when bits get scrambled, lost, and ruined.
* Index maintenance – Databases need regular upkeep so they'll continue to run well.
* Disk management – It's actually your job to find out about full disks before they happen. After all, databases grow!
* Alerting – Alerts tell you what's wrong, so you don't have to go looking for problems.

Being a database administrator is a big job, but we can cover the basics in one session!</p>

<h3>The Anatomy of Select</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>TSQL is one of the most valuable tools any SQL Server professional can add to their tool-set. More aptly, TSQL is a whole chest of tools for the SQL Server professional. One of the most important tools in that TSQL chest is a good understanding of the SELECT statement.

When was the last time you sat down to evaluate a SELECT statement? What actually goes into the processing of that teeny little word? There might be a fair bit more to this simple term than just fetching data from the database. This session covers the simplicity of the select. Then we take it a step further to dive into some of the complexities tied directly to this particular statement.

This session will help the attendee better understand the Select statement. With a more solid understanding of this statement, the attendee can return and implement some of this new knowledge to help improve processing and query response times in their own environments.</p>

<h3>Professional Networking</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Provide an overview of how to develop professionally through effective networking. The idea of networking can seem overwhelming at times and is avoided altogether.  One of the purposes of this session would be to share solutions how to overcome fears associated with networking.  Networking is relationship building and would discuss best practices and the benefits of a having a strong network.  
The session would cover tips and recommendations of how to network effectively, make introductions to new contacts, asking the right questions and proper follow up.  It would also cover best practices on networking at user group meetings and SQL Saturdays.  Demonstrate how tools such as Twitter and LinkedIn can help increase a personal network and make connections with decision makers.</p>

<h3>Build a White/Blacklist Bouncer. Who Gets into Your SQL Club?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Are too many systems hitting your SQL Servers? Do you know who they all are? Are you under attack?
When it comes to this type of problem the consensus is to get with your network and domain admins to adequately configure access options. 
What happens when you can't wait or don't even have folks in that role to get the configuration right? 

A blacklist is a list of what cannot access something you are trying to protect. (Like the TSA no-fly list. If you are on the list, you are not getting anywhere fast.)

A whitelist is just the opposite. It is a list of what is permitted to access something. If whatever is attempting access is not on the list, it isn’t getting in.
In this session, we will go through the process to create and test your own SQL based whitelists and blacklists and also take a look at how whitelisting is being used in SQL 2017 to control what CLR objects can be trusted to run in your environment.</p>

<p>Graphs are everywhere!  Microsoft has added a lot of new features to SQL Server 2017 (and 2019), and among them SQL Graph has been one - one that holds a lot of promises, though it's still in its early stages (at least with Microsoft's offering).  Microsoft added SQL Graph features to their 2017 release, and has added support for MERGE (UPSERT) scenarios to ease insertions into edge tables, and Edge Constraints to apply restrictions on relationships between nodes in 2019 release (in CTP 2.0).  In this session, we'll take a look at what this feature brings to the table, and how it compares with other Graph databases.</p>

<h3>Intro to Query Store</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session, we will look at the new Query Store feature in SQL Server 2016 and 2017.  Query Store tracks changes in execution plans, allowing you to easily view performance differences and revert to older plans with a few clicks of the mouse in 2016.

Then in 2017, Microsoft added wait stats per query plan and Automatic Tuning capabilities.  Allowing DBAs more tools to troubleshoot fires with and a way to automatically resolve issues.

In this session, we will walk through the features of Query Store, so you can understand how to use them in SQL Server 2016 and 2017.</p>

<h3>Azure Data Engineering</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As Microsoft releases new Azure features, migrating your ETL processes to the cloud is becoming easier all the time, but also more confusing.  Understanding the use and connectivity of the different storage and services is more critical than ever.  I'll start with an overview of Azure data components, detail how they can be integrated, and demo the lift and shift of existing SSIS packages to Azure.  I'll also demo some dynamic ways to program Data Factory and the features of the brand new Data Factory Data Flow!  Throughout, we'll discuss best practices for different Azure centric data migration strategies and explore the benefits of adopting an ELT approach.</p>

Started using SQL 6.5 in 1998 then moved to the City of Chesapeake as their first DBA.  Professional focus is OLTP, multiple people using the same database quickly. Hobby is giving technical presentations at science fiction and anime conventions. Yes that means I like Star Trek more than Star Wars (fighting words in some areas)</p>
