<h3>Why should I care about the plan cache?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this first (and hopefully not last) installment of Rick's "Why should I care" series a case for why working knowledge of how to query the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments, followed by a review of relevant DMV's for the newly motivated audience. Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why their DBA is sometimes so moody.</p>

<h3>SSAS Multidimensional vs. SSAS Tabular – Which one do I use?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With the release of SQL Server 2012, we were introduced to two possible options when it came to Analysis Services.  This ultimately presented a question…”Which one do I use SSAS multidimensional or SSAS tabular”?  

Determining whether multidimensional or tabular is the optimum solution for your organization is a key step when working with SQL Server Analysis Services 2012/2014. This session will introduce you to some of the common pitfalls with each solution and how you can avoid them. By the end of this session, you’ll have a clearer understanding of the strengths and weakness of each model and how your organization can optimally leverage the strengths of SSAS 2012/2014.

<h3>SQL Server Foreign Keys – De-mystifying the Rest of the Story</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Foreign Keys are the ultimate Catch-22; you need them for data integrity, but they just kill insert, update, and delete performance.  In this session we will describe the concept of Foreign Keys and how they maintain data integrity.  You will learn their syntax for creating, deleting, disabling, and re-enabling.  You will also learn the possible effects of disabling and re-enabling Foreign Keys for data modification.   We will also examine the two most important Foreign Key attributes:  is_not_trusted and is_disabled and their effect on query performance.  All of these characteristics will be demo'ed with many script examples.
After attending this session you will 
1.	Comprehend the pro and cons of Foreign Keys in a real world production environment
2.	Understand the consequences of disabling and re-enabling Foreign Keys for data modification
3.	Be able to better assess best approach for Foreign Key maintenance

<h3>Design and Implement BI Like Edison! </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As the most prolific inventor in American history, Thomas Edison was a master of “Best Practices!” Edison’s creations were not just novel and commercially successful, but many launched entire new industries including electric light and power, sound recording, motion pictures and industrial cement and concrete manufacture. At the heart of Edison’s remarkable record of innovation was his categorization of the innovation process into “competencies,” or bundles of skills supporting the achievement of success in a particular area of endeavor. In this session, we will look at ways that we can use many of these broad success secrets to bring powerful tools and strategies to the recurring implementation of business intelligence.</p>

<h3>Testing SSIS Packages</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Senior developer: “How do you test your code?” Junior developer: “I compile it.” It’s an old joke, but too often this reflects the reality of testing. If the code compiles, it has passed its test. Sadly, this principle is sometimes applied to Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) processes as well: “When the SSIS package runs without error, testing is complete.” 

As in software development, testing of SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) packages should not end at when the package executes successfully. You must also confirm that the package does what it was intended to do without placing an undue performance burden on the system.

This session walks through design patterns for testing SSIS packages during and after the development process. The session covers topics such as these:
* Performance testing
* Patterns for validating execution results at runtime
* Validating package metadata before execution
* Design time versus runtime testing
* Making a graceful exit: testing for error handling</p>

<h3>Introduction to R and Data Science Tools in the Microsoft Stack</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>R is the most popular statistics language used today. It is one of the most useful tools in the data scientist's tool belt. It is also integrated into the MS stack in tools like Azure ML, SQL Server and Power BI and can be used to take your data analytics to the next level.

Come to this session to get an introduction to the R language including installing and configuring R and RStudio, how to access and manipulate data, install packages, create and use variables, use control flows and some basic graphing and statistical analysis. We will finish with a very brief introduction of how R integrates in Azure ML, Power BI and SQL Server.

The focus of the session will be primarily on the introduction to the R language and getting attendees comfortable with using R to start the journey to Data Science! </p>

<h3>Overcoming Chartaphobia And Moving Toward Enlightening Data Viz</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Do your organization's reports consist mostly of giant tables of data? Perhaps you have gotten as far as adding KPI indicators or conditional highlighting to the tables. Although tables of data presented as reports are commonly found in many organizations, they may be doing you and your users a disservice. You should optimize your data viz just as you optimize your databases. Reports are a user interface that must be purposefully designed to help users achieve their goal of making informed decisions. In this session, we'll review requirements gathering and data viz best practices and apply those concepts to the use of Microsoft reporting tools such as Excel, Power View, and Reporting Services. You'll leave with guidance on how to take boring, unreadable tables of data and turn them into useful and visually appealing reports. </p>

<h3>Mastering and Enhancing Company Data</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Getting a good 360 degree view of organizations (customers or vendors) or doing customer centric analysis is often complicated as a result of bad data/ duplicate data / inconsistent data coming from multiple systems. In addition, there are external factors like mergers and acquisitions, inter-company relationships and other nuances that may not be captured in source systems. Getting a clear picture of customer and vendor data can not only provide a clear picture for analysis of information, but also aid in critical risk management functions. In this session, you will learn about some techniques and data services from DB that you can use to clean and enhance your data.</p>

<h3>Incorporating Azure Machine Learning to SQL Server Environments</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Azure Machine Learning [ML] is a great tool for gathering more insight with your data, but how do you know if the models you are using are providing the best results? How do you apply modules customized to analyze your data? After this session you will have the answers to these questions, as well as the knowledge necessary to implement machine learning data analysis into your data environment.
Using Azure based SQL Server, attendees will learn rules which can be used to classify the data and the type of analysis desired by Azure ML.  Building upon this information, the best methods for determining which ML models to use will be shown.
This presentation will demo how to extend the flexibility of Azure ML by implementing custom analysis from other sources. Incorporating items created in R and SQL will show the expanded capabilities available outside of the existing ML components.  Lastly we will deploy the Azure ML solution and incorporate the results into our SQL Server Database.

<h3>Always Encrypted in SQL Server 2016</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server 2016 introduces a new feature called Always Encrypted. This feature allows data to stay encrypted 100% of the time in transit to and from the server, can keep it encrypted at rest, and offloads the encrypt/decrypt operations off the server to be handled exclusively by the client. Always Encrypted can also be used with whole database encryption (TDE). In this presentation we will talk about what Always Encrypted is, how it is different from the encryption options currently available, and how database administrators can even be prevented from seeing the data! Demos will be done in both SQL Management Studio and in Visual Studio 2015.</p>

<h3>Power BI is Awesome!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Microsoft has changed its Business Intelligence strategy in the last few years from an IT centric approach with SQL Server Reporting Services and SQL Server Analysis Services to an end-user ad-hoc approach with Power BI. Initially the Power BI tools were all separate add-ons to Excel 2010+ that you had to know where to get them and install/activate them individually. Now with new Power BI product announcements and Power BI Desktop, the full vision of these once separate tools is becoming more clear and cohesive as an end-user ad-hoc analysis and reporting tool. In this demo heavy session you will see how Power BI is now a much more complete solution and how it can change how you deliver analysis and reporting to anyone in your company. Demos will include using Power BI Desktop to pull in data from multiple sources and repeatable transformations to clean usable data and build interactive reports and dashboards.</p>
