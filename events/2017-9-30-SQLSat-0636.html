<h3>Refresh a 1TB+ database in under 10 seconds</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The presentation covers recoverability options in SQL Server over time.  It will take us through many different ways of recovering a large 1TB+ database.  It will also walk us through many different options for creating development/test/uat environments.  It will highlight the benefits and shortcomings of these options while delivering a business value of each.  It will also evaluate a high level ROI of each of these options.
Finally, the presentation will focus on an architecture based on SAN technologies with respect to SQL Server.  I will demonstrate an architecture put in place resolving many business needs in a financial trading environment, working with large data sets and many different environments.   This section will highlight the benefits of using SQL Server together with newer SAN solutions and show the potential for reliability, scalability, and the delivery of a high quality HA/DR solution. That is where things get interesting...</p>

<h3>DBA 102: Now What</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Things happened, you got a knock on the head and when you awoke your boss said “congratulations” you are our new DBA, perhaps you came to the role in a more intentional manner or are just DBA curious.  Your environment is running but you are wondering “now what” or “what’s next”.  In this session we will give an overview of a few things that could, perhaps even should be next and give some recommendations as to where you can find more resources on-line and maybe even suggest a few sessions to attend at this very SQL Saturday.  So, what will be covered, recovery strategy (you think I mean backups, I don’t, you’ll see why), a touch on performance tuning with a hint of indexing thrown in, add a pinch of high availability and a smattering of security all of which will give you some idea how to answer “now what”.</p>

<h3>Got stress?  Sometimes the SQL Server needs some too</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>We hear it in every session and every webinar “…test…” regardless of it being upgrades, new code, performance tuning or any of a thousand changes.  Once we confirm nothing breaks., we don’t need to check anything else, nothing could possibly change the results, right?  What about load on the database(s) in question or the server as a whole?  In this session four readily available tools, distributed replay, Hammer DB, SQL Query Stress and oStress will be introduced.  The session will cover how to use the tools as well as which situations they shine in.  Once introductions are made, we will spend a little time with two of my favorites, HammerDB and SQL Query Stress.  Join me as we apply a little heat to our SQL Servers.</p>

<h3>DBAs vs Developers: JSON in SQL Server 2016</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The war between DBAs and developers has been raging since the dawn of relational databases. One reason for disagreement comes from developers who want to store their data in JSON because it is fast, standard, and flexible. DBAs cringe when they hear of long text strings being stored in their SQL databases; they cry with concern, “No data validation? No schema binding?”. Is there any hope for these two warring factions to see eye-to-eye?

This session will explore the new JSON functionality introduced in SQL Server 2016. We will use T-SQL examples to learn how these functions can be used to parse, create, and modify JSON data. More importantly, we will discuss how to optimize performance when using these functions.

By the end of this session DBAs and developers will know how to efficiently work with JSON in SQL Server 2016. It will also usher in an era of peace between DBAs and developers…

… at least until someone brings up the topics of cursors, NOLOCKs, or Entity Framework.</p>

<h3>Machine Learning Melee: AWS vs Azure</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The world is drowning in data and there’s a gold rush in the business of turning data into actionable insight. In one corner, stands AWS, a long time cloud services innovator, that wants to leverage its PaaS dominance to take it into the next decade. In the other corner, stands a scrappy re-invigorated Microsoft with a new focus on making the cloud smarter.

Both are feverishly working on creating compelling solutions for developers to build intelligent solutions upon. Is one better than the other? What are each one’s strengths and weaknesses?

And what does Google have up its sleeve?

Come to this session to get a first hand account of a former Microsoft evangelist now working at an AWS partner startup, who promises to keep it a good clean fight!</p>

<h3>Cross Tabs  Pivots - Much More Than Just Converting Rows to Columns</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session covers and compares the PIVOT operator to an ancient but very high performance pivoting method known as CROSS TABs.  Single and double column pivots will be covered and the “secret” to quickly making CROSS TABs is “Copy’n’Paste” easy.  We’ll also introduce a couple of “Black Arts” techniques called “Pre-Aggregation” and “Divide’n’Conquer” to build a quarterly report for 1 year from 10 years and 10 MILLION rows of data in just half a second.

If time allows, we’ll also discover that you can very quickly format reports as pretty as you’ll see in SSRS without using SSRS.

Don't let the "Intermediate" rating of this session scare you beginners away because we start at the ground floor and work our way up to some very high performance code.  Even if you already know how to use PIVOT or CROSS TABs, you won’t want to miss this one.</p>

<h3>Geo Location of Twitter messages in Power BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There are several custom solutions that make Twitter messages analysis possible in Power BI. And with a recent addition of the Campaign/Brand Management for Twitter solution template for Power BI (https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/solution-templates/brand-management-twitter/) it's getting even less complicated to get into this social media mainstream data exploration.

This solution has several components:
- Logic App passes tweet into an Azure Function
- Azure Function enriches tweet and writes it to Azure SQL
- Azure Function also calls Azure ML experiment running Python script to work out sentiment of tweet
- Power BI imports data into it from Azure SQL and renders pre-defined reports

However, Geo location for twitter messages is not available (if we want to filter them by a particular country). Let's try to explore with live demos if we can customize this Azure solution and add a Country filter to our Power BI reports based on live tweet data.</p>

<h3>Tools for the DBA Newbie: What I Wish I Had Known Years Ago</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Are you an DBA newbie looking for tools to improve your product and client experience?

In this session, you’ll be equipped with tools to improve query tuning, indexing tuning, and naming standards. You’ll understand helpful built-in technologies that often go unused, server setup practices, and performance logging. And you’ll hear about the best blogs to follow and where to get help from the community.

I’ve learned all of this gradually, but I’m happy to give you a head start. I’ll share insights that I’ve gained transforming our 18-year old, single-tenant database into a thriving multi-tenant SaaS environment. This talk is intentionally broad, demonstrating how we retooled our database and the wealth of information we discovered along the way.   If you are just starting your SQL Server performance journey, this talk will give you at least one thing to dig into on Monday morning.</p>

<h3>Using Filetables</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The FileStream feature allows BLOBs to be managed by the DB.  FileTable expands on this feature by using specific tables for storing these BLOBs. This allows Windows apps to access these items as if there were stored on the file system but with benefits only a database can offer, such as text searching and querying.</p>

<h3>Stop Doing That! Common T-SQL Anti-Patterns</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There are several programming design patterns that work great in object oriented code but do not scale  inside SQL Server. Things like Scalar-Value functions, Unions, CTEs, and row by row processing can make for more work then you would expect.

In this session, we will focus on several anti-patterns like these and show how to rework them to improve scale in the database engine.   

By the end of the session, you will be able to quickly identify these common anti-patterns and analyze their sometimes unclear cost to the engine. Heading back to the office, you’ll be able to identify pain points in your longest running queries from a T-SQL perspective and become a code tuning rockstar!</p>

<h3>Maintain SQL Server Performance Baseline w/PowerShell</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Maintaining a solid set of information about our servers and their performance is critical when issues arise, and often help us see a problem before it occurs.  Building a baseline of performance metrics allows us to know when something is wrong and help us to track it down and fix the problem.  This session will walk you through a series of PowerShell scripts you can schedule which will capture the most important data and a set of reports to show you how to use that data to keep your server running smoothly.</p>

<h3>SQL Server on Linux for SQL DBA.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>For the last 25 years SQL Server DBAs administered SQL databases using only Windows GUI.
For majority of them even Windows Core is too hard to accept.
In the situation, when Microsoft invaded Linux territory with it's flagship product, as SQL DBA, you must not outsource SQL Server administration to some Linux geeks. 
You can do it yourself!
Your way!

<h3>Finding more space for your tight environment.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If you do not have enough space  in your hard disk and do not want buy more space, one way to get more space is compress the tables and also do some house keeping.

I will use T-SQL script to generate script to compress each tables and release the free space by shrinking the datafiles.
And in the final I will defragment the indexes and update the statistics, since shrink datafile is not fragmentation aware task.</p>

<p>I#39;m a DBA who has gone through most of my career with few people to learn and unsure of where to find great help until I found a real mentor.  When I started at a company with a great, knowledgeable manager and learned to find others speaking about SQL Server online my skills boomed.  This is especially true in my most passionate area, SQL Server performance.  

Knowing that my knowledge came from others, I now have a second passion of sharing my knowledge with others.</p>
