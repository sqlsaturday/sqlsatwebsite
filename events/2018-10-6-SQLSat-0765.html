<h3>Continuous Integration Pipelines With Jenkins, Docker and SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Docker has taken the world of IT by storm and looks to be ushering in the greatest platform paradigm shift since virtualisation and the public cloud. The transient nature of Docker containers makes them the perfect fit for spinning up and then tearing down SQL Server instances as part of continuous integration pipelines. Jenkins is the most popular build automation engine in the open source community, it has phenomenal plugin support, it is used by the likes of Netflix and eBay and excels in its ability to handle build pipelines as code. In this session you will learn how a simple build pipeline that takes a SQL Server data tools project checked out from source code control, built into a DACPAC which is then deployed to a SQL Server instance can be extended to use containers, multi-branch build pipelines, tSQt testing and much much more.</p>

<h3>The language of graph databases and SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server 2017 introduced the extension for graph databases. As there are millions of SQL Server users worldwide, this feature broadens enormously the audience of potential users. 
But, what to expect exactly from a graph database? How to query it? Is SQL Server fully featured compared to other products?
In this session we answer these questions. We start illustrating the concepts behind the model; how relationships are handled and what are the common patterns and issues for a graph. What are the data connections a graph can easily represent.
Then we compare the semantic model with SQL Server to discover how to apply it to real world. We analyze some case study: pattern matching, path finding, aggregation, ranking … For each of them we show how to use standard T-SQL and how to rewrite the query using graph objects. What is the benefit of reformulate our queries in terms of clearness and performances, what is already available in order to consider SQL Server a valuable player.</p>

<h3>Start testing your SSIS packages with ssisUnit</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>How do you test your SSIS packages? Do you prepare them, set the parameters and variables, maybe get some sample or production data and run few times by hand in SSDT? It’s not a bad practice when you start your ETL journey, but after some time you probably think about automation. If not – you should. Perhaps you have some SQL scripts that verify data in the tables after package execution, but if you are like me, somewhere inside you feel that it’s not enough. It’s time you start automated SSIS unit and integration testing.

On this session, I will show you why you should and how to start with automated testing of the packages and the whole projects using ssisUnit – the free SSIS testing library. I will start with some basics and move forward to the real-life examples of the unit and integration testing of the SSIS packages/ projects/solutions. You will see the benefits of automated testing and that testing is hard only at the beginning.</p>

<h3>Boosting SSAS productivity with Tabular Editor</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Authoring SSAS tabular models using the standard tools (SSDT) can be a pain when working with large models. Tabular Editor is an open-source alternative, that relies only on the Model.bim metadata and the Tabular Object Model (TOM). Compared to SSDT, making changes to measures, calculated columns, display folders, etc. is lightning fast, and the UI provides a "what-you-see-is-what-you-get" experience, making it much easier to manage and author large models. In this session, we will briefly go over the basic features, and then dive into the productivity enhancing features of Tabular Editor, such as scripting, custom actions, the Best Practice Analyzer, command-line build and deployment, and much more. You will never want to use Visual Studio for Tabular Modelling ever again! Attendees will also have the opportunity to ask questions or provide feedback about the tool.</p>

<h3>SQL Server Containers in Azure</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Running SQL Server in Docker containers brings benefits that data professionals shouldn't be ignoring. Over the last year the images provided by Microsoft have matured to a point where running SQL Server containers in production is a viable option.

However, running standalone Docker containers presents challenges so other technologies are need to support them. This session will provide an introduction to the various options for running SQL Server containers in Azure.

I'll cover the following different topics:-
The Azure Container Registry
Azure Container Instances
Azure Container Services

This session is aimed at SQL Server DBAs and Developers who have some experience with Docker and want to know the different options that are available in Azure.

Each topic will be backed up with demos which will show how simple it is to get up and running with these technologies</p>

<h3>Collecting Performance Metrics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Ever had a manager standing over your shoulder, wanting to know why an instance is running slow or if it can handle additional workload? What information would you use to answer these questions? If only you knew what performance metrics to collect and had them for your existing instances to answer these questions. 

In this session, we will be combining three open source tools - Telegraf, InfluxDB, and Grafana - into an inexpensive system that collects performance metrics you can use to troubleshoot issues and answer important questions about your SQL Server instances, including your Linux SQL Server instances. We will learn what metrics to collect, how to use the tools to collect performance metrics and then we'll put it all together in an interactive dashboard for easy visualization.</p>

<h3>Graph Data in SQL 2017</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When I read that Microsoft have added graph data to SQL Server 2017 I was intrigued as to what graph data is so I started doing some research.
This presentation is the culmination of my investigations. 
If you design complex OLTP relational databases or have data that doesn't fit the rigid hierarchy of a relational database then this talk is for you. 
You may be in for a surprise!

Some of the questions we will look at:
What is Graph Data?
Who uses it?
What is it used for?
How does it compare to traditional relational database design?
What other companies support graph databases?
How does it work in SQL 2017?
Is there a new language to learn?
What is the so-called Kevin Bacon problem?

And finally.
Will it replace traditional relational database design within the next 10 years?</p>

<h3>Shard Attack - Horizontal Scaling in Azure SQL Database</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Traditionally, when a server starts to reach its limit we have simply thrown more resources at it, either more CPU, memory or disk. 
However there comes a point, especially in the cloud, where it is no longer possible to add more resources to a single database.  Here we need a different solution.
Instead of scaling up we must scale out, sometimes called horizontal scaling or sharding.
 
In this talk we will look at how to scale out in Microsoft Azure SQL database using the Azure Elastic Database tools
We will look at the requirements and options for horizontal scaling in Azure and then we will have a go at sharding an Azure SQL database and then querying and updating the different shards
We will be using t-sql, PowerShell and c# so come prepared for some serious coding</p>

<h3>Now Where Did THAT Estimate Come From?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The SQL Server Query Optimizer makes its plan choices based on estimated rowcounts. If those estimates are wrong, the optimizer will very likely produce a poor plan. And there's nothing you can do about it. Or is there?

In this session, you will learn exactly where these estimates come from. You will gain intimate knowledge of how statistics are built and maintained and how they are used to estimate row counts. But you will also learn how filters and joins influence those estimates.

Though the focus of this session is on understanding the cause of bad estimates, you will also learn ways to fix the problems and get better estimates - and hence, better performing queries.</p>

<h3>Don't Use Cursors or Why You Maybe Should Use a Cursor After All</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You might have heard "don't use cursors, they are slow!". In this presentation, you will learn what actually means: you should normally write set-based statements instead and I will explain why they generally are faster than writing your own loops. But I will also look at situations where using a loop for one reason or another is preferrable, and you will learn that the best way to run a loop in most cases is exactly a cursor, provided that you implement it properly. The presenation also gives some tips how you can troubleshoot performance problems with loops.</p>

<h3>SQL server window functions</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>All database users know about regular aggregate functions which operate on an entire table and are used with a GROUP BY clause. But few people use Window functions in SQL. These operate on a set of rows and return a single aggregated value for each row.

The main advantage of using Window functions over regular aggregate functions is: Window functions do not cause rows to become grouped into a single output row, the rows retain their separate identities and an aggregated value will be added to each row.

In this session I will walk through the syntax of window functions as well as demonstrate common use cases for where window functions.</p>
