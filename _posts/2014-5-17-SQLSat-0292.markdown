## Title: The Sqoop on Big Data from it’s humble beginnings to rise to notoriety
 
**Abstract**:
Everywhere you turn in the technological literature people are talking and writing about Big Data. In this presentation you will learn about the origins of Hadoop, and how it is implemented today. In addition to the most infamous way of retrieving data from Hadoop, Map Reduce, there another way to manipulate the Hadoop data.  It is possible to query the data from Hadoop in SQL Server through the use of Sqoop. In order to better understand the logic behind Sqoop, I will present information on the Hadoop components.  Having this information will help you determine how the tools all fit together so that you will know which tools are the best choice for getting the desired answers from your data sources.

## Title: Building a Database Deployment Pipeline
 
**Abstract**:
The pace of business accelerates fairly continuously and application development moves right with it. But we’re still trying to deploy databases the same way we did 10 years ago. This session addresses the need for changes in organizational structure, process and technology necessary to arrive at a nimble, fast, automatable and continuous database deployment process. We’ll use actual customer case studies to illustrate both the common methods and the unique context that led to a continuous delivery process that is best described as a pipeline. You will learn how to customize common practices and tool sets to build a database deployment pipeline unique to your environment in order to speed your own database delivery while still protecting your organization’s most valuable asset, it’s data.

## Title: Partitioning System for "WORM" Tables
 
**Abstract**:
This isn't your typical talk on "partitioning".  This is a deep dive into all the problems that you'll run into when partitioning new or existing "Write Once, Read Many" tables, such as large Audit Tables, and how to code around them.  You'll also learn the methods to support three of the best reasons for partitioning such monster tables... MUCH shorter nightly index maintenance, MUCH shorter and smaller backups, and MUCH shorter "Get back in business" piecemeal restores.  We'll also learn how to do the "impossible"... compact a File Group (one per partition) so that there's virtually no unused space in the underlying file.  After all, we don't want to set any "free" disk-space to "Read Only".  Don't let the "Advanced" rating of this session scare you away.  Anyone with a decent handle on T-SQL (or wants one) will be able to understand this session because "all will be explained" and there will be oodles of well-documented code to back up the explanations.

## Title: What Just Happened? Why You Need to Constantly Monitor Your Environment
 
**Abstract**:
You get back from lunch on a Friday and your inbox is exploding with emails from the users claiming the system is hanging. What do you do now? How are you going to figure out what is currently causing the issue and what started the problem in the first place? 

In this session you'll learn why it’s important to monitor what your server is doing and track any changes that have been made. You’ll learn about the components you can use to create your own solution as well as some real world examples of how correct monitoring can help you troubleshoot day-to-day issues. You’ll also see how it can help the new DBA get a grip on what’s going on in their environment. 

Full-time monitoring can provide you with quick answers to many common issues; such as “random” system slow-downs, deadlocks, and that pesky SQL error the users see once every two months. Having a great infrastructure in place can leave you with more time for the fun stuff, like online training and post-lunch power naps.

## Title: Getting Started Reading Execution Plans
 
**Abstract**:
The best way to understand why your query is running slow is to look at the execution plan. But, knowing how to get started in execution plans, what to look for, what's important, can all be terribly confusing. This session will provide you with a simple set of tasks to get you started reading execution plans. You'll learn where to start, what to look for first, and you'll be better prepared to tune your queries. We'll also look at some methods you can use to write queries against the plans themselves in order to more easily and quickly identify potential issues within your plans. The information presented will be immediately applicable on the queries you have running back in the office.

## Title: SQL Audit - auditing doesn't have to be boring
 
**Abstract**:
Let's face it, auditing isn't fun.  But if you're a DBA, you need to know what's going on in your SQL Server instance.  Fortunately, SQL Audit makes it easy.  In this session, we'll cover what you can and can't audit using SQL Audit, enhancements in 2012, configuring database and server audits, ways to process output, and ideas for how to implement SQL Audit on a larger scale.

## Title: Extending SQL Server with Advanced Analytics and R
 
**Abstract**:
The Microsoft SQL Server stack provides an excellent set of tools for storing, visualizing, and analyzing data, but sometimes we want to do more. In this session, we’ll take a look at the open-source statistical software R and how we can use it to connect to SQL Server, analyze data, and put the results of our analysis back into SQL Server for later use. We’ll look at examples of analyses performed by a fictional company as they segment their customers, forecast their sales, and examine interesting relationships among their product offerings. Along the way, we’ll see what some of these analyses would take if done in SQL Server itself and why R is so effective when paired with SQL Server.

## Title: Automate Your ETL Infrastructure with SSIS and PowerShell
 
**Abstract**:
Much of your ETL process flow consists of packages that are very similar in structure, capturing data from a single source and transferring that to a single destination.  Creating the individual packages can be tedious and it's easy to miss something in the process of generating the same basic package over and again.  BI Markup Language makes it easy to build new packages, and PowerShell makes creating the BIML scripts easy.  In this session we'll show you how to use PowerShell to generate dozens of SSIS packages doing similar tasks from a defined set of ETL sources.

## Title: SSIS Templates Can Make Your Life Easier
 
**Abstract**:
How many times have you started a new SSIS project and added the same components that you’ve added to almost every other package you’ve created?  Components to handle logging and errors or even a standard workflow for loading data files.  In this session I’ll show you how you can create standard templates that already contain any and all of the common components you desire.  We’ll also look at how to implement and use these templates so that the next time you create a SSIS package you can spend your time on the work you actually need to do instead of implementing common components over and over again.

I am a father of 4, and live in Raleigh North Carolina. I love fixing problems, and learning new technologies that can help me fix those problems faster and better than I did the time before.

In my spare time I like to read, speak, and learn new things. I currently work as a Database Administrator at ChannelAdvisor where I solve fairly interesting problems on fairly large databases.

You can often find me on Twitter where I talk about SQL, beer, and anything else I find interesting.
