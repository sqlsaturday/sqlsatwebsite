## Title: New Security Features in SQL Server 2016
 
**Abstract**:
It seems like that every month we hear about another company having a major data breach. GDPR raises the stakes with huge fines for those that lose or don't keep data safe.
Ensuring that your data is secure has become more important than ever.

With this in mind, in SQL Server 2016, Microsoft gave us three new features that have the potential to improve the security of your SQL database, either on premises or in the cloud.
These are:
Dynamic Data Masking which allows us to obfuscate data in real time
Always Encrypted which helps protect data both at rest and in motion with a master key 
Row Level Security that gives us control over who can see which rows in a table based on the user's rights

In this session we will have an overview of these important security features and demos on how to configure them and make them work.

## Title: Continuous Integration Pipelines With Jenkins, Docker and SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Docker has taken the world of IT by storm and looks to be ushering in the greatest platform paradigm shift since virtualisation and the public cloud. The transient nature of Docker containers makes them the perfect fit for spinning up and then tearing down SQL Server instances as part of continuous integration pipelines. Jenkins is the most popular build automation engine in the open source community, it has phenomenal plugin support, it is used by the likes of Netflix and eBay and excels in its ability to handle build pipelines as code. In this session you will learn how a simple build pipeline that takes a SQL Server data tools project checked out from source code control, built into a DACPAC which is then deployed to a SQL Server instance can be extended to use containers, multi-branch build pipelines, tSQt testing and much much more.

## Title: Execution plans ... where do I start?
 
**Abstract**:
SQL (the language) is not a third generation language, where the developer tells the computer every step it needs to take. It is a declarative language that specifies the required results. SQL Server itself will figure out what steps it takes to get to those results. Most of the time, that works very well.

But sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes a query takes too much time. You need to find out why, so you can fix it. That's where the execution plan comes in. In the execution plan, SQL Server exposes exactly which steps it took for your query, so you can see why it's slow.

However, execution plans can be daunting to the uninitiated. Especially for complex queries. Where do you even start?

In this session you will learn how to obtain execution plans. and how to start reading and understanding them.

## Title: T-SQL User-Defined Functions, or: How to kill performance in one, easy step
 
**Abstract**:
User-defined functions in SQL Server are very much like custom methods and properties in .Net languages. At first sight, they seem to be the perfect tool to introduce code encapsulation and reuse in T-SQL. So why is this feature mostly avoided by all T-SQL gurus?
The reason is performance. In this session, you will learn how user-defined functions feed the optimizer with misleading and insufficient information, how the optimizer fails to use even what little information it has, and how this can lead to shocking query performance.
However, you will also see that there is a way to avoid the problems. With just a little extra effort, you can reap the benefits of code encapsulation and reuse, and still get good performance.

## Title: What to Do When SQL Server is Unusually Slow
 
**Abstract**:
“Is something going on with the SQL Server right now?” You hear those words, and your heart starts to race a little faster. You try to connect to the SQL Server, and it responds, but you can tell it’s a little slow. You open up Activity Monitor, look at recent expensive queries, and maybe open up the Windows event logs to see if anything’s happened recently.

There’s gotta be a better way, right?

Good news – there is, and you’re about to learn how the pros do it. In one all-demo session, you’ll watch Brent Ozar use sp_WhoIsActive, sp_BlitzFirst, and sp_BlitzCache to solve several common emergencies. You’ll walk away with a written checklist to solve typical performance emergencies.

## Title: Improving data quality with Data Science and Machine Learning (no math required!)
 
**Abstract**:
Data Quality is one of those things that we don't pay attention to until it comes and bites us, and when it does, its usually a customer that notices it. As always, the poor beleaguered dev/database guys pay the price and work long hours and over the weekend to track things down and sort things out.

In the good old days we could rely on things like MS Data Quality Services to come to the rescue, however, now we operate in the cloud with a mixture of Vendor products, database types and at different scale, so what are the options open to us, especially on a limited budget?

This session will examine using basic Data Science and AI techniques along with open source solutions and tools, to help improve your data quality, no matter the format of the data and where it is stored. It will also demonstrate a new Open Source Data Validation/Quality toolkit Allen is developing that runs naively in the cloud for both data at rest and live streaming data at rest and live streaming data in moti

## Title: Python Pipeline Primer: Data Engineering with Azure DataBricks
 
**Abstract**:
Azure DataBricks brings a PaaS offering of Apache Spark, which allows for blazing fast data processing, interactive querying and hosting of ML models all in one place! Most of the buzz is around Data Science  AI - what about the humble data engineer who wants to harness the in-memory processing power within their ETL pipelines?

This session focuses on Azure DataBricks as your data ingestion, transformation and curation tool of choice. We will:

	• Introduce the DataBricks service  why we use Python
	• Discuss the hosting  compute options available
	• Demonstrate a sample data processing task
	• Compare against alternative approaches using SSIS, U-SQL and HDInsight
	• Demonstrate pipeline management  orchestration
	• Review the wider architectures and extension patterns
	• Compare and contrast to new Azure Data Factory Data Flows

The session is aimed at Data Engineers seeking to put the Azure DataBricks technology in the right context and learn how to use the service. We will not

## Title: Revenge: The SQL!
 
**Abstract**:
Pop quiz DBA: Your developers are running rampant in production. Logic, reason, and threats have all failed. You're on the edge. What do you do? WHAT DO YOU DO?
Hint: You attend Revenge: The SQL! 
This session will show you how to "correct" all those bad practices. Everyone logging in as sa? Running huge cursors? Using SELECT * in ad-hoc SQL? Stop them dead, without actually killing them. Ever dropped a table, or database, or WHERE clause? You can prevent that! And if you’re tired of folks ignoring your naming conventions, make them behave with Unicode…and take your revenge!
Revenge: The SQL! is fun and educational and may even have some practical use, but you’ll want to attend simply to indulge your Dark Side. Revenge: The SQL! assumes no liability and is not available in all 50 states. Do not taunt Revenge: The SQL! or Happy Fun Ball.

## Title: Analyzing Performance Problems Using XEvents, DMVs  Query Store
 
**Abstract**:
Extended Events, Dynamic Management Views, and Query Store are highly useful tools that give you a lot of data when analyzing performance problems. The challenge is which tool to use for which problems and how to correlate the data.

You are troubleshooting a performance problem in a business-critical database, a query is not completing, the users are complaining, and you are trying to understand what is happening. You have data from Extended Events, you are looking in the execution related DMVs, and now you are trying to find the query in Query Store. How do you put it all together?

In this session, we will look at how the tools work in different scenarios, how to correlate the data, and how you can use them in your performance troubleshooting.

## Title: Permission Granted... Oh, No!
 
**Abstract**:
Working as a DBA, I came across some creepy things in what comes to database user (abusive) rights! 
From users that were database owners, simply because they had to be able to truncate tables and read/write data to users that were Sysadmin because they needed to Bulk Insert into one table in one database!!!!
Yes... Creepy things as I said!
This is a very sensitive and (sadly) common issue, so in this session I'll be speaking about Permissions Management and demonstrate how we can address it in the best way, i.e. giving the necessary permissions without incurring into the risk of compromising the security of an entire database or SQL Server instance!
I will also show how easily this can be done ;)
