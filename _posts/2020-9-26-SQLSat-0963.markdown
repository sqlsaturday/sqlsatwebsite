## Title: Infrastructure as Code: An Introduction to Terraform
 
**Abstract**:
Building reliable and repeatable infrastructure deployments thatcan be transitioned through Development, Test, and into production is becoming increasingly essential. There are many options including PowerShell, ARM, Cloud Formation and many more that you can use depending on your cloud of choice. But what if you want vendor lock in? Enter Terraform. An open source Infrastructure as code platform that works with Azure, AWS, and others as well as on-premises environments.

Together we will work through the what, why, and how of infrastructure automation with Terraform for building solutions. We will build a data platform solution and look at how we can transition through environments with VSTS and integrate this into development and operations processes that will let you concentrate on delivering more value to your users.

## Title: Analyze and solve common wait stats scenarios
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server is a high frequently used piece of software which need to serve single requests and/or hundreds of thousands of requests in a minute. Within these different kinds of workloads Microsoft SQL Server has to handle the concurrency of tasks in a fashion manner. This demo driven session shows different scenarios where Microsoft SQL Server has to wait and manage hundreds of tasks. See, analyze and solve different wait stats due to their performance impact:
- CXPACKET: when a query goes parallel
- ASYNC_IO_COMPLETION: speed up IO operations (Growth / Backup / Restore)
- ASYNC_NETWORK_IO: What happens if your application refuses data?
- THREADPOOL starvation: crush of requests for Microsoft SQL Server
- PAGELATCH_xx: How does Microsoft SQL Server protects data?

## Title: Top 5 Skills that a DBA will need in 2020
 
**Abstract**:
It’s the year 2020 about ten years ago many people were writing about the demise of the DBA and how they won’t be around in ten years time. As we move into a new decade, and those ten years have passed the DBA role is still alive and kicking. Albeit, it has evolved in the last ten years and it has changed considerably since I started my career in the early 2000s.
In this session we will look at what skills you would expect a DBA to have in 2010 and compare it to what they will need in 2020. No doubt we will be covering:
•	New versions of SQL Server
•	Automation and PowerShell
•	Continuous integration
•	Cloud technology
•	Maybe some non-technical skills too
If you want to get my take on what skills a DBA needs to have in the Roaring 20s then this session is for you.

## Title: What's Going On in My Power BI Environment?
 
**Abstract**:
As Power BI is a self-service tool, it can be hard for administrators to monitor it. Power BI is fast improving in this context but there still isn’t a consistent way of monitoring it. There are compliance, governance, performance, and implementation questions to consider. Who is creating content, how is it being distributed, what data is being used, how long does the refresh take and how is it changing, who has a trial license, and what report is the most used? These are just some of the questions you as an administrator of Power BI might want to get answers to. 

In this session, we will look at how you can find those answers by monitoring Power BI. We will look at the Power BI Audit log for usage, license, and other audit information. We will look at what the Power BI API can show us about data sets, refresh history, Enterprise Gateway information, premium capacity, and artifact inventory. The audience leave the session ready to start their own monitoring of all or some of the topic

## Title: Easing the pain of database migrations to the cloud - Planning, process and great tools!
 
**Abstract**:
An essential part of migrating your application workload to the cloud is how to transfer your data securely to its new home. If you in addition want to change the underlying database system, for instance Oracle to SQL Server, it can quickly escalate to an overwhelming task. What if your application have a very high uptime requirement and your database is so large that you don’t not have a downtime window long enough to do a traditional backup/restore operation? In order to overcome these pain points we have now available, both in Azure and AWS, services and tools that alleviate these pains and brings your valuable data safely across with near-zero downtime.

In this talk we will:
- Guide you through how to set up a migration process with checks and balances
- Compare the schema analysis and conversion tools provided by AWS and Microsoft
- Compare the migration services provided by AWS and Azure
- Demonstrate near-zero-downtime migration for a live database on AWS and Azure

## Title: Advancing Databricks - Next Level ETL
 
**Abstract**:
Azure Databricks has been around for a while now, and Apache Spark since 2012. You've watched a couple of demos, got a brief overview of what Databricks does and you've got a rough idea of where it fits in… but where do you go from there?

This session is that next stop. We'll start by taking a deeper look inside the spark engine, understanding what makes it tick and how it talks to data. We'll then break down some of the key features that come together to build the kind of data processing task that's changing how we think about ETL.

We'll be looking at:
 - RDDs  How data is stored
 - Schema Inference
 - Storing Metadata
 - Parameters in Notebooks
 - Integration with Data Factory

Each of these features comes together to build a single, generic notebook that can validate the rows within a dataset that meet a specific structure, and it's all driven by metadata!

We'll be doing everything in python, so a light familiarity will help but is not mandatory

## Title: SQL Notebooks in Azure Data Studio for the DBA
 
**Abstract**:
An Azure Data Studio recent release introduced SQL Notebooks as a capability. While you might have read about notebooks being used for Data Science, this session is primarily for DBAs. 

We will cover installing Azure Data Studio.
What a SQL Notebooks is.
Using PowerShell in Notebooks in Azure Data Studio
Numerous use cases for you to use SQL Notebooks in your daily workload such as creating a Notebook for Glenn Berry's Diagnostic queries.

## Title: Common Data Service, why is it not common yet?
 
**Abstract**:
Within the Power Platform, there's a data store called Common Data Service (CDS). But why would you use it? You've several hundred connectors allowing you to connect to almost every type of data storage. Well, CDS is an easy way to define and centralize business logic over multiple, interconnected applications handling various types of data.

In this session, we have a good look at CDS and find his strengths and weaknesses. We'll see how to build, ingest and extract data from CDS using demos. When you're using the Power Platform and/or curious about CDS but haven't used it yet, join me at this session.

## Title: Power BI Paginated Reports - How to and why should I care
 
**Abstract**:
Power BI Report Builder is the tool to build paginated reports in Power BI and even though its a Power BI Premium feature - it could be a handy tool in your BI toolset that you should know about.

I will demo how you can build reports based on a Power BI dataset and how to parameterize the report.

I will also show how you can use paginated reports without having a Power BI premium capacity by using Power BI Embedded SKU's to create datadriven subscriptions.

Power BI enthusiastic, public speaker and passionated for everything which transforms data into action! Working at Macaw in the Netherlands as a Data  Analytics consultant.

What I like the most? Sharing my thoughts, experience, best-practices and enthusiasm about Power BI and related Microsoft Products with others. I mostly do this in public speaking for the user group, conferences, customer presentations and end-user training. But wouldn't it be great to cross borders and expand the community!
