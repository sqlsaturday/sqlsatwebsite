## Title: SSDT, Docker, and (Azure) DevOps: How to Make Your Database Builds a First Class CI/CD Citizen
 
**Abstract**:
Your application developers benefit from Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment practices to accelerate feature deployment and catch regression issues up front, but your database deployments are still stuck in the proverbial dark ages. The build scripts might be in source control or even an SSDT project already, but deploying is still an exercise in creating the perfect script, and don't even think about making a data (or data type) change!

SSDT and Azure DevOps can solve some of these problems, and even give us a window into the world of automated testing. In this talk, we will explore how to automate your database builds and deployments using SSDT and Azure DevOps, and we will explore automated testing using tSQLt and Docker. Lastly, we will check up on some tasks that you cannot (or should not) automate and talk about how to make sure your application developers are not left behind.

## Title: Get your Git on with Source Control
 
**Abstract**:
Have you tried implementing source control? How has your continuous integration (CI) process gone? 

This session is for developers, database administrators, database engineers, and data architects that want to automate their database deployments. Particularly for those individuals that have hit roadblocks along that way. We will discuss the differences between migration and stated-based deployment methods. We will also discuss options with branching and merging. 

At the end of the session, attendees will know how to select the best deployment method for their environment. In addition, attendees will be familiar with branching and merging strategies that can be used as part of their continuous integration strategy.

Attendees should be familiar with general concepts about source control and be comfortable with Visual Studio or VS Code.

## Title: Azure Security, Cost, and Capabilities
 
**Abstract**:
Security, cost, and capabilities are the key questions for any Azure project. Nothing should be implemented today without a tested security surface. Creating a strong and flexible identity perimeter will allow for secure access. Platform security will create a secured perimeter for all of your cloud resources from Virtual Machines and Networks to resource locks and permissions. Manage customized security alerts, and configure a playbook for specific threats. Configure security for data infrastructure, and data encryption at rest. Implement security for applications such as certs, monitoring, and security baselines. Data and applications will not last long if costs are not managed from the beginning. You will need to monitor and analyze the cost of your Azure resources as soon as development begins. Azure Cost Management allows you to create a budget. The biggest factor in security, and cost management is implementing the right capabilities to support your business requirements.

## Title: Zen and the Art of Baselines
 
**Abstract**:
If your boss asked you for the list of the five most CPU-hungry databases in your environment six months from now for an upcoming licensing review, do you have an answer? Performance data can be overwhelming, but this session can help you make sense of the mess. Twisting your brain and looking at the data in different ways can help you identify resource bottlenecks that are limiting your SQL Server performance today. Trending this data over time will help you project how much resource consumption you will have months away. Come learn how to extract meaning from your performance trends and how to use it to proactively manage the resource consumption from your SQL Servers.

## Title: Environment Setup using automation tools like Docker, Powershell and Chocolatey
 
**Abstract**:
Environment setup in some organizations can take days and even then it is not consistent and has components missing or configured incorrectly. These problems can be solved and this session will cover several techniques for doing just that. In this session we will use Docker to create 3 SQL environments. The first is a production like environment for UAT. In the second environment will redact the confidential data and in the third environment reduce the dataset by 90%.

This three tiered environment setup can work with or without Docker. In this session we will also cover using Chocolatey NuGet's, which sounds tasty, but it is also a very powerful method of installing software on Windows.

## Title: An Introduction to Partitioning
 
**Abstract**:
Large tables in SQL Server present challenges on several fronts. For query performance, avoiding accessing data unnecessarily becomes more important. For ETL, loading and modifying data while utilizing compute resource and avoiding lock contention becomes more difficult. For maintenance, making efficient use of resources and time presents challenges. 

In this session, we will introduce the core concepts of partitioning in SQL Server -- partitioning columns, partition schemes, and partition functions. We will configure heaps, rowstores, and columnstores as partitioned tables, and execute queries to compare how they access data. Finally, we will work with the requirements for switching partitions in and out of tables.

After this session, you will be able to configure partitioned tables, explain how partitioning affects query execution, and switch partitions in and out of tables.

## Title: What is DevOps and Why Should DBAs Care?
 
**Abstract**:
You may have heard the term “DevOps” a lot lately, but is this just one of those buzzwords that gets thrown around and means something different depending on who’s talking? While traditional software methodologies pit developers and operations folks like DBAs against each other, DevOps requires that they work together for a common goal. And, ultimately, shouldn’t the software project’s success be everyone’s goal? 
Attend this session to learn how DevOps is changing the DBAs world for the better.

## Title: Getting Started with SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS)
 
**Abstract**:
In this session, geared toward beginner level users, attendees will be introduced to SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) as a tool for customized reporting. We will first review the SSRS workspace in Visual Studio 2017 to familiarize users with the various components that can be used when building reports. We will then look at a few examples of reports to see some of those components in action, focusing on the usage of parameters and expressions to provide flexibility, before finally building a sample report together. We will conclude by walking through the deployment process and discussing both basic and data-driven subscription options for automated report delivery.

This session is designed for users with little to no familiarity with SSRS who are looking for a baseline understanding of the tool, who want to begin working more with SSRS development, or who need to support SSRS in their current role but do not know where to begin.

## Title: SQL DevOps Simplified with Production Databases
 
**Abstract**:
DevOps is based on building an application binary (immutable artifact) that supports a highly reliable, repeatable engineering process.  In the case of SQL Server, however, a database is already in production, and isn’t simply replaced (as an app binary), but is upgraded.   Current SQL Server DevOps methods use source control to build a “development” database, with schema and objects and static data needed for functional testing.  "Near production data" is used in Staging, and finally production is upgraded.  This approach involves complexity, and breaks the principle of working with immutable artifacts throughout the process.  Our session introduces a new approach to SQL Server DevOps, with production databases used in all stages.   Production database clones are delivered more quickly than "built" databases, are more easily integrated with source control, and produces higher fidelity outcomes.  Learn how leading enterprises are simplifying SQL DevOps.

## Title: Hands-On Query Tuning Workshop
 
**Abstract**:
You know query plans can help you fix T-SQL performance issues, but maybe you aren’t sure of all the ways query plans can help.  Maybe you use index suggestions, but you wonder if you could do better.  Maybe you’ve never used a query plan at all.  Come to this workshop and learn!

Let’s roll up our sleeves and dig into some T-SQL performance work.  We’ll work together to examine query plans and enhance query performance.  Feel encouraged to take part in the conversation, no matter your experience level.  We’re all here to learn!

You’ll get even more out of the session if you bring a device that can use OpenVPN (if you have SQL Server Management Studio or another client) or remote desktop (if you don’t).  You can then experiment on your own to discover suggestions for the group and see improvements for yourself.

When you leave the session, you’ll have more practical ways to fix slow T-SQL the next time you run into a real-world performance problem.

## Title: Pseudo-Constants in SQL
 
**Abstract**:
You know you’ve done it. Maybe it was the lucky number 7. Maybe it was an enigmatic X. Maybe you smooshed some words together in ALLCAPS. That should be easier to spot, right? Because some day you might need to change it—in every stored procedure, function, and view.

Magic numbers, codes, identifiers, constants, enumerations. Whatever you call them, all applications have them. Sure it’s quick and easy to sprinkle the values throughout your code, but that breeds mistakes, rigidity, and obfuscation. There has to be a better way!

Other languages give us real constants and enums—with IntelliSense and compilation-level enforcement. Well guess what-- SQL Server does too, sort of. Join us and learn to write clearer, easier to maintain code without sacrificing performance.

## Title: Dammit Jim! Dr McCoy’s Field Guide to system_health (and the default trace)
 
**Abstract**:
As DBAs, we are asked all sorts of impossible questions.  Who dropped that important table last month?  Why was everything slow last week?  Who made that user a sysadmin?  You’d have to be a mind reader to know the answers to some of those, right?  Not necessarily!  SQL Server can help you find information about these and other common problems with its default trace and system_health Extended Events session, but you have to know how to collect and interpret the data they provide.  In this session, we’ll explore what system_health and the default trace are, what information they contain, and how to use them to find the answers you’re searching for.

## Title: SQL Server 2019 - New Features and Enhancements
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2019 is in Public preview for almost 1 year. Microsoft promises that it is going to be released for consumption this year. Like previous versions, SQL Server 2019 comes with a plethora of new features as well as with enhancements to the existing features. In this session, I will discuss new features such as Accelerated Database Recovery, PMEM (persistent memory device), Hybrid Buffer pool, In-memory Optimized Tempdb, etc. 
This is an introductory session to introduce you to these new features. There will not be enough time to do any meaningful demo but there will be plenty of time to ask questions. You will leave this session with a solid understanding of some of the best new features of SQL Server 2019 which will help you and your company make decisions such as when and why to upgrade your database platform.

## Title: MongoDB and SQL Server 2019: The Odd Couple
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft is pulling out all the stops when it comes to SQL Server 2019 integration with "Big Data" solutions. With the expansion of PolyBase to handle external data in MongoDB, moving data from "unstructured" documents into relational tables in SQL Server is theoretically simple. However, MongoDB is designed to allow for spontaneous schema changes. Our fussy SQL Server won't like such sloppiness! In this session, we will explore SQL Server 2019 features, such as PolyBase, SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), and T-SQL features such as JSON support, that facilitate integration with MongoDB. The demonstration will include moving data between our Odd Couple of database paradigms, and building in safeguards to keep the two systems from having issues. Can two incompatible databases share data without driving each other crazy?

## Title: Control PHI and Sensitive Data Risk for Self-Service BI using Power BI DataFlows and Azure Data Lake
 
**Abstract**:
Protected Health Information (PHI) and other forms of sensitive data are an area of concern in all industries. Highly regulated industries such as Healthcare and Financial Services have a great deal of person-specific information in their systems, and often restrict the use of self-service Business Intelligence (BI) to prevent the wrong people from seeing the wrong data. This presentation will review new ways to safely enable self-service BI for an enterprise without introducing additional risk of PHI or sensitive data violations. I'll review strategies and architectures that include Power BI DataFlows with Azure Data Lake to eliminate sensitive data from a self-service BI environment. An infrastructure leveraging these tools can still have highly controlled and governed enterprise Power BI reports that carefully distribute PHI and sensitive data to targeted users, while also enabling self-service BI without an increased risk of sensitive data violations.

## Title: Managing ETL Change Using BIMLScript
 
**Abstract**:
Change is constant, especially with source files. Health care claims data files change at least yearly. You develop an SSIS package to load the source file. You meticulously identify each of the columns and map them to the targets. Your package runs fine for months. Then the file format changes. Again, you tediously select each column, etc. Wouldn't it be nice to simply document the structure of the file, the file's metadata, and generate the SSIS from that metadata? Your users demand the documentation anyway. If the file changes, you simply change the metadata. 

To demonstrate such an approach, I import some US census data. I create the SSIS package using BIMLScript and metadata. When the format changes, I change the metadata and generate a whole new package. And if your whole ETL approach changes to say Azure Data Factory? I will demonstrate how to generate an Azure Data Factory pipeline from the same metadata.

## Title: Maximum SQL Server on VMware Performance
 
**Abstract**:
Virtualizing your business-critical SQL Servers should not imply that they will run slower than if they were physical. When properly architected and managed, virtual SQL Servers should be equally as fast as their physical counterparts, if not faster. However, if not properly constructed and managed, silent and seemingly random performance killers can strike and significantly hurt your database performance. 

This session is packed with many tips and tricks gained from years of experience for getting the most performance from your VMware-based SQL Servers. The major roadblocks to performance will be discussed and the knowledge gained will help you work with your infrastructure engineers so you can optimize the system stack for performance. Tools, techniques, and processes will be demonstrated to help you measure and validate the system performance of the key components underneath your data.

## Title: Power BI Dataflows - What do you mean it's about storing data?
 
**Abstract**:
Power BI Dataflows are an emerging technology from Microsoft in the Power BI space (not to be confused with Azure Data Factory Dataflows, of course). Power BI Dataflows are emerging as some features are still in preview. The part that is not clear in the name is that this is not purely and ETL function. Power BI dataflows allow you to store data in Azure Data Lake. Depending on how you configure your solution, you can use the Common Data Model as well. Let's dig in an create a dataflow using native Power BI functionality then we will look at using an existing ADLS as well.

## Title: Diagnosing and fixing deadlocks in SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
You know how locking works in SQL Server, but now you are tasked with diagnosing and fixing deadlocks. How do you take the knowledge you have and apply it to address deadlocks in your production database?

In this session, we will discuss how you can use free tools to detect and analyze deadlocks in your system. We will do a deep dive on deadlock XML with an eye toward interpreting the information automatically collected by SQL Server when the free tools fall short. 

Attendees will leave with the understanding they need to develop solutions to deadlocks in their systems.

## Title: Azure SQL Database Managed Instance - Almost But Not Quite the Same
 
**Abstract**:
Let's talk about Managed Instance, the newest member of the Azure SQL Database family. It's a WHOLE lot closer to out-of-the-box SQL Server than other flavors of Azure SQL DB. But it's still got some differences. Do those matter for you?  What exactly is it? What is it good for (or not)? How much does it cost? Just how compatible is it with existing systems? How can I move data in and out of it? How is my data protected, for HA, DR, and backups? What else do I need to know about it?

Bottom line: Does Managed Instance make sense for me?
