## Title: 5 Query Plan Culprits That Cause 95% of Headaches
 
**Abstract**:
Ever open a huge query plan to track down a performance issue and find yourself overwhelmed by the number of objects on the screen? How do you figure out which part of the plan is causing the problem? What should you do about it? The vast majority of query plan troubles boil down to the same basic causes; solving them is simply a matter of knowing where to look. In this session you will learn how to open a plan and drill in to the most likely problem areas. Once there, a simple analysis of five key indicators will help you diagnose your performance problem faster than you thought possible. Say goodbye to guesswork and game playing. This session will teach you how easy it can be to apply a bit of logic to improve performance of your queries.

## Title: Database Design Fundamentals
 
**Abstract**:
In this session I will give an overview of how to design a database, including the common normal forms and why they should matter to you if you are creating or modifying SQL Server databases. Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have been proven for many years. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against the way data should be structured and can be avoided by applying the basic normalization techniques and are obvious things that you find yourself struggling with time and again (i.e. using the SUBSTRING function in a WHERE clause meaning you can't use an index efficiently).

## Title: Automating SSIS Development with Biml
 
**Abstract**:
SSIS is a great tool for transferring data from one data source to another, and for implementing complex ETL processes. However, there are some painful shortcomings that make it difficult to automate package creation, easily reuse patterns and templates, and create packages directly from schema information and other metadata.  The free and open source BIDS Helper Add-In offers support for automatically generating SSIS packages using the Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml). 
In this session we will start by showing the power of Biml.  We will then step back, and start from the beginning of using BimlScript.  Once we cover the basics, we will cover practical examples using the BIDS Helper add-in to automate SSIS development.

## Title: Bridging the Chasm:  BI Theory vs. Practice
 
**Abstract**:
A Dynamic Dialog session: According to research compiled by Gartner from discussions with many BI clients, a substantial disparity exists, in the implementation of BI, between theory (standard approaches, promises, claims and expectations) and practice (shortfalls, compromises and other realities). In this session, Business Intelligence Architect and Microsoft MVP Bill Pearson leads a dialog within which we gain an understanding of the general types of discrepancies between the “ideal” approach to BI and the compromised reality that a large number of organizations experience. We’ll then share and class experiences as a group, and discuss ways to avoid these discrepancies in future projects.

## Title: Taking BI to the Next Level: Collaboration
 
**Abstract**:
Self-service BI is usually an independent activity. But when individuals discover interesting information that they want to share, they need a centralized location to do that. When people work together, new insights are possible, and that’s what collaboration is all about. As more people see the benefits of the solution, they become more likely to use it. As individual products, SQL Server 2008 R2, SharePoint 2010, and Excel 2010 expand your options for enabling BI in your organization, but collectively they create a solid platform for collaborative BI. Knowing which tool to use for which job can be tricky. Come to this session to learn how to use these tools to foster collaboration.

**Abstract**:
Back in the old days, compression and databases was a really bad idea. Now, with powerful CPUs we can use to both improve performance and save disk space. We will cover the basics of how all compression and deduplication works, and then we will learn how SQL Server page and row compression work, and the special compression that is used in SQL 2012 Columnstore Indexes. We will demo performance and space savings in using compression.

## Title: Storage for the DBA
 
**Abstract**:
One of the biggest issues in database performance centers around storage.  It’s also one of the hardest places to troubleshoot performance issues because storage engineers and database administrators often do not speak the same language.  In this session, we’ll be looking at storage from both the database and storage perspectives.   We’ll be digging into LUNs, HBAs, the fabric, as well as RAID Groups.  In addition to theory, we’ll be looking at an actual EMC SAN so that we can translate what we see in the Storage Array with what we see on the actual server.

## Title: Working with "Biggish Data"
 
**Abstract**:
Most database professionals know (from firsthand experience) that there continues to be a "data explosion", and there's been a lot of focus lately on "big data".  But what do you do when your data's just kind of "biggish"?  You're managing Terabytes, not Petabytes, and you're trying to squeeze out as much performance out of your aging servers as possible.  The focus of this session is to identify some key guidelines for the design, management, and ongoing optimization of "larger-than-average" databases. Special attention will be paid to the following areas: * query design * logical and physical data structures * maintenance  backup strategies
