## Title: Data Mining in the Microsoft Stack
 
**Abstract**:
If you want to be a successful business intelligence analyst in today’s market, you need to bring more to the table than fancy dashboards and drill through pivot tables.  Now, you need sophisticated cluster analysis, decision-trees and bona fide product recommendations. In this session I’ll show you where to find the free Microsoft tools that allow you to tap into these features of SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2 and beyond. After this session you will be able to create everything above without learning R, or stepping out of the Microsoft BI stack. You’ll see how you can create fantastic data visualizations that are better than you could accomplish in the same time with years of experience in expensive statistical packages like SAS or SPSS. More importantly than the how’s, you’ll leave knowing the when’s to use these powerful data science tools.

## Title: Automating Execution Plan Analysis
 
**Abstract**:
Many SQL Server performance issues can be solved with the information available from the DMVs, even if it is collected only after the problem occurred. But management might ask why something that was not an issue yesterday became an issue today i.e., who is to blame? On modern server systems with many powerful processors cores and massive memory, problems may be infrequent, but they do still occur. And so we may have neglected to collect and archive data on a routine basis. It is equally important to collect sufficient information to fully diagnose and a resolve a problem. Too many (all?) third party tools seem to stop after identifying a problem on the presumption that the the DBA’s responsibility ends with passing this information to someone else. To this end, I have automated the collection and partial analysis of index usage, query execution statistics and executions plans in my own tool ExecStats (http://www.qdpma.com/ExecStats/SQLExecStats.html)

## Title: Columnstore Indexes in SQL Server 2014: Flipping the DW Faster Bit
 
**Abstract**:
Columnstore indexes were introduced in SQL Server 2012  have been wholly re-architected  optimized for SQL Server 2014. Columnstore indexes are optimized for data warehouse workloads  are a hybrid technology leveraging the best of off-disk  in-memory capabilities. Transparent to the app, columnstore has been shown to render queries at sub-second response times which heretofore took many minutes or longer. This presentation includes an overview of SQL Server 2012  a deep dive into SQL Server 2014 columnstore indexes, including a review of the architecture, as well as the challenges, workarounds, travails,  big wins at customer sites  inside MSIT. The presentation is rich in demos, including leveraging IaaS—Columnstore in The Cloud. Learn whether columnstore can change your users' world  why columnstore may be a compelling reason to upgrade. Learn how columnstore indexes flip the DW faster bit  why columnstore manifests my motto, “Change the world or go home!”

## Title: SSIS project deployments with multiple developers
 
**Abstract**:
Before SQL Server 2012, it was easy to develop several SSIS packages in a project and deploy each package as you complete it.  However SQL Server 2012 introduces the project deployment model.  With its awesome features comes the limitation that you can no longer deploy a single package.  You must deploy the whole project every time!  How do you deploy a project that contains a mix of deployed packages, ready to deploy packages and packages in development?

In this session I demonstrate common problems that arise in the package development lifecycle that affect project deployment.  I will then demonstrate how to use Team Foundation Server to address these problems.  I will develop the story for handling packages at various stages of development using TFS.

## Title: Peace of Mind: Making DBCC CHECKDB Go Faster
 
**Abstract**:
Along with backups, consistency checks are arguably the two most important tasks that DBAs need to perform regularly. Our databases are getting bigger every day, and CHECKDB run times, along with its performance impact to Production systems, keep increasing. In this session we discuss how to improve your system so that you can reduce the time that it takes to run CHECKDB or the individual DBCC CHECK* commands. We will cover topics like Transaction log and VLF management, tempdb configuration, trace flags, Resource Governor, and many more. In one of many the demos we will explore a real life example where SurveyMonkey's consistency checks were taken from 7 days down to 6 hours.

## Title: SQL Aggregation Queries Tips and Tricks
 
**Abstract**:
In your OLTP database you often need to find category or yearly totals. Most people are familiar with getting totals by using GROUP BY with an aggregate function. What if you want get market share reports like how each product is selling as it’s percentage of the total category. You can combine aggregate functions with individual records without even using GROUP BY or nesting your queries. 
•	Learn about aggregation queries that combine totals in the same records set as your row data.
•	Learn to write aggregation queries that don’t use the GROUP BY keywords
•	See how aggregate table data by groups or partitions using all types of aggregate keywords
