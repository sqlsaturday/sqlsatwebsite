## Title: Wait Stats: What are they and why you should care.
 
**Abstract**:
Many Application Support personnel, IT support, and even some DBA's are occasionally bombarded with "My application is slow", "the database keeps timing out", and many other end user complaints when supporting applications in any industry.  Instead of simply blaming it on the developers or simply brushing it off as a "vendor problem", wouldn't it be nice to understand the issues and notify the correct party?  This presentation is intended as a primer for wait stats.  Introducing the concepts, discussing why it's useful, then discussing a few ways that you can take this knowledge and apply it using a number of different approaches.  At the end I've also provided some examples of various LIVE environments I help manage so we can discuss what issues may or may not be prevalent.

## Title: Business Analytics with Microsoft Power BI 101
 
**Abstract**:
The world of data is changing. Mobile, social, and cloud trends are vastly increasing the quantity and types of data available for businesses to leverage in their decision making and strategic planning. Many leading companies are already taking advantage of these newer data trends to improve operational awareness, increase customer reach, and attain better market visibility. Some of the newer features (Power BI) of familiar products such as SQL Server, SharePoint, and Microsoft Office allow businesses to more easily achieve these goals by using technologies they already own.  

This session will provide a high-level overview of Business Intelligence and Big Data, discuss industry trends and use cases, and provide a live demonstration of a Business Analytics scenario using Microsoft Power BI and other tools.

## Title: Learn PowerShell or Die! for the DBA
 
**Abstract**:
Learn PowerShell or Die! That is, learn PowerShell or your career in IT will die. PowerShell is one of those technologies that as a DBA you’ll either love or hate, but believe it or not DBA’s already have the mindset for scripting since you live and work with T-SQL day in and day out. During this session, scripting games winner Mike F Robbins will demonstrate the different methods of retrieving information from your SQL Servers to include a way to simply wrap your existing T-SQL code inside of a PowerShell one-liner, working with SQL Server in PowerShell as if it were a file system, and creating reusable tools via functions in PowerShell that use SMO to retrieve just about any information about your SQL Servers that you could imagine.

## Title: Managing Access Control with PowerShell
 
**Abstract**:
Access control in Windows, while very powerful, can be very complicated. Working with securitydescriptors one object at a time through the GUI is fairly straightforward, but that doesn’t help when you need to verify and/or configure settings for multiple objects at the same time. There are utilities available to handle this in an automated fashion, but most only work with certain types of objects, and they each have their own syntax. Fortunately, PowerShell has the ability to replace most, if not all, of those utility applications. In this session, we'll cover ways to use PowerShell to view and edit access control lists for almost any object in Windows that is secured with a security descriptor, including files, folders, registry keys, services, processes, WMI namespaces, Active Directory objects, and more. We'll cover using both native PowerShell commands, .NET methods, and the free “PowerShellAccessControl” script module.

## Title: AlwaysOn - Finally, A usable 'mirror'!
 
**Abstract**:
In the past, High Availability and Disaster Recovery (HADR) had many limitations. Clustering and Mirroring are great, but the mirror/secondary database is not very usable since it is not online.  Finally, AlwaysOn solves this limitation by merging both multi-node Clustering and mirroring. AlwaysOn also allows the secondary database to remain ONLINE, so we can use it for reporting purposes without resorting to a Snapshot!  Come see this lively session with extensive demos of setting up, configuring and testing AlwaysOn. We'll also test automatic fail-over using a real web app to see how well this feature works.

**Abstract**:
Every industry has a governing body or standard that requires some layer of security to your data.  In my travels I have come to realize that when someone mentions security, DBA's tend to get frightened.  This could be due to a lack of understanding of the requirements or not knowing what SQL Server offers to meet those requirements.  In this session we will go over what SQL Server has to offer, Security Best Practices and how you can shrink your attack surface to meet Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of your Servers and Data.
In addition, attending this talk is worth 1.5 Continuing Education credits.
