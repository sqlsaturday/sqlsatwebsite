## Title: SQL Server Foreign Keys – De-mystifying the Rest of the Story
 
**Abstract**:
Foreign Keys are the ultimate Catch-22; you need them for data integrity, but they just kill insert, update, and delete performance.  In this session we will describe the concept of Foreign Keys and how they maintain data integrity.  You will learn their syntax for creating, deleting, disabling, and re-enabling.  You will also learn the possible effects of disabling and re-enabling Foreign Keys for data modification.   We will also examine the two most important Foreign Key attributes:  is_not_trusted and is_disabled and their effect on query performance.  All of these characteristics will be demo'ed with many script examples.
After attending this session you will 
1.	Comprehend the pro and cons of Foreign Keys in a real world production environment
2.	Understand the consequences of disabling and re-enabling Foreign Keys for data modification
3.	Be able to better assess best approach for Foreign Key maintenance

## Title: SS2014 In-Memory Tables:  Formula 1 Performance Unleashed?
 
**Abstract**:
Query performance is what it is all about.  SQL Server 2014 now has the new in-memory functionality that takes a completely different approach to data access and manipulation.  Google “In-Memory Tables” and you’ll get a myriad of results from white papers, blogs, webinars, etc.  This session will consolidate the relevant information from all these sources so the production DBA/Developer will be able to understand, create, use, maintain, and trouble-shoot in-memory table functionality.  This session will also examine several demo scripts showing performance gains using the in-memory tables over equivalent disk based tables.  
This session is all about when and how to apply in-memory tables in a production environment.
After this session you will
1.	 Understand what in-memory tables are and how to create and maintain them including their limitations
2.	Be able to identify performance gains over equivalent disk back tables
3.	Comprehend the new data monitoring needed for in-memory table

## Title: Possible Musics: Choosing between SSAS Multidimensional and Tabular
 
**Abstract**:
The Analysis Services 2012 (and above) Business Intelligence Semantic Model (BISM) unifies Multidimensional (OLAP) and Tabular (relational) options for organizational BI.  BI professionals can implement Multidimensional cubes, or they can deploy Tabular models, developed by business users, to a dedicated server.  Those new to Tabular, or those embarking upon BI for the first time with Analysis Services 2012, may find it difficult to choose between the two paths.  In this session, BI Architect, SSAS Maestro and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson overviews the nature and design goals of each option, comparing Multidimensional and Tabular features.  He then offers guidance on selecting the appropriate model, providing real world examples to illustrate approaches for given scenarios.

## Title: Introducing Forensic Analytics with Power BI
 
**Abstract**:
Despite the wealth of analytical technologies available today, 65% of fraud at public companies is detected through tips, management review, or simple accidents.  Forensic Analytics combine human intuition and leading-edge technologies, and can provide superior detection methods to significantly improve the detection and investigation of illegal or unethical activities.
In this session, we explore Forensic Analytics: a set of techniques we can use to uncover irregularities in financial data. We also gain an understanding of goals of Forensic Analytics: to enable us to find out how — and why — these irregularities exist, and to find out their source(s) — especially when fraudulent activity is suspected.  We discuss guiding principles that are key to isolating data anomalies, and outline a standard, repeatable process to Forensic Analytics. Throughout the session, we view examples of how we can employ Power BI to drive Forensic Analytics via various tests and reviews.

## Title: How to troubleshoot beyond what you understand
 
**Abstract**:
Troubleshooting can be easy when the cause of an issue is obvious - except sometimes it isn't because it's not. In those cases, how do you find the cause - especially when it's something you don't directly control? You're having issues with your storage, but is it a result of RAID being setting up improperly or a constraint on the fiber channel switch? Can you tell the difference between a blockage of firewall ports and a network switch that's nearing capacity? You're not a SAN admin or a firewall engineer, but you don't need to be to understand enough to identify whether these systems are involved.

In this session, we'll talk about troubleshooting as a process - how you can identify issues beyond what you can see and may not understand. While we may discuss some specific situations or hard-to-identify causes in the examples, the session will be focused on understanding the impact of different issues, and how you can better identify the cause of an issue when it's outside your system.

## Title: Mastering and Enhancing Company Data
 
**Abstract**:
Getting a good 360 degree view of organizations (customers or vendors) or doing customer centric analysis is often complicated as a result of bad data/ duplicate data / inconsistent data coming from multiple systems. In addition, there are external factors like mergers and acquisitions, inter-company relationships and other nuances that may not be captured in source systems. Getting a clear picture of customer and vendor data can not only provide a clear picture for analysis of information, but also aid in critical risk management functions. In this session, you will learn about some techniques and data services from DB that you can use to clean and enhance your data.

## Title: Turbo Boost Performance: In Memory Tables index optimizations
 
**Abstract**:
With the introduction of in-memory based tables in SQL Server 2014, it’s natural to expect  significant increases in query performance. But what do we do when queries which utilize in-memory tables actually start to perform same or, in some cases, even worse than their equivalent disk based table predecessors?  In this session, we are going to take a look at the changes to the indexing design for in-memory based objects and how it differs from existing disk based table indexing. Also, we are going to cover how to choose the appropriate indexes for your in-memory object to give you the performance boost that you have been expecting.

## Title: Table Partitioning -Beyond the Basics
 
**Abstract**:
You've read about table partitioning; you know that partitioning ‘promises’ to solve some performance issues, make backups -and even restores, faster, and, wait, wait, there’s more! Perhaps you have worked through demo code and set up a POC scenario. It looks good, like maybe it would solve some of the problems your organization faces.

But …

You’re just not sure how to pull it off. Sure, the demo code made it seem easy -and it will always be realtively simple for new tables, new data. You have a handle on the ‘basics’. However, your production database has very large tables, hundreds of millions, or even billions, of rows. The SLA does not allow much, if any, downtime.

This session will look at how Table Partitioning can be introduced into existing production environments with little or no downtime And we will explore the ‘real’ performance and maintenance benefits that can be harvested. So, if you want to move beyond the ‘Basics’, don’t miss this session.

## Title: The Tricky Part of Doing Tricky Things in your Data Model
 
**Abstract**:
We've mastered the basics of data modeling and data modeling patterns, but what happens when you or a teammate wants to use this one weird trick to improve on the data model and the resulting database design? Have you just discovered a brilliant new trick that no one else has ever thought of? Or will your new design cost you more, take on more risk and cause all kinds of pain for both IT and your business users?
We'll look at a few tricks that we've seen in our database design review and show you how they work and talk about the trade offs for using them. You'll learn about:

Building a database engine inside your database
Designing before understanding your business model
Dealing with data structures that don't do well in RDBMSs
Optimizing the developer versus the data or the app
Using design patterns that don't reflect modern architectures and tools
…and a lot more

## Title: End to End Protection with Always Encrypted in SQL Server 2016
 
**Abstract**:
Protecting our data from unauthorized access becomes more and more important all the time, however it has been difficult to ensure sensitive data is encrypted in SQL Server. The new Always Encrypted feature in SQL Server 2016 makes this much simpler for developers and DBAs with a framework for protecting data from the client, across networks, and inside of the database. This new feature allows for limiting access to the data, even from the DBAs and sysadmins that may control the database instance itself. Learn how to implement and use Always Encrypted in your applications.

## Title: Working with Object Compression in SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
"SQL Server 2008 introduced object compression to the DBA toolkit. We all know there are different kinds of compression available in SQL Server. What you might not know boils down to some subtleties of compression. For example, not all page compressed objects are entirely page compressed. Many pages can be uncompressed or just row-compressed.
 
This session shows you how to reach into the database and discover compression states at the page level. At the lower level, this session also shows how to determine compression settings of objects in the database. You can use both some undocumented and more commonly known commands to derive some interesting information from the database engine.

## Title: Microsoft Presents: Don’t forget the licensing!
 
**Abstract**:
It may not be the most exciting topic, but it can quickly become the most important topic for a project! Many developers and architects make technical decisions based on features and capabilities, but do not consider licensing as part of the decision making process. Other times decisions are made by perceived licensing costs, that may not truly impact a customer’s environment. In this session Matt Smith will provide an overview of licensing options and details to consider for SQL Server including editions, versions, agreements, and software assurance. After an initial level set, Matt will then focus on guidance and best practices for licensing a SQL Server environment across a number of scenarios such as: Virtualized environments, public and private cloud scenarios, support, upgrades, high availability and disaster recovery scenarios.

## Title: Bare Naked Skinny on SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Ever feel like there are just too many layers with SQL Server? You peel off a layer and behold there is yet another layer. SQL Server is rather complex. The complexities can be rather frustrating from time to time. 

Join this NSFW (not safe for whining) session as we strip SQL down to the bare bones. I will help you undress the complexities of a few of the basic SQL Server concepts. These concepts will include locks, principals, query directives and deadlocks.

In this session I will disrobe misunderstandings related to the aforementioned topics. I will show the different types of principals in SQL Server. I will also show various scenarios involving locks and deadlocks along with some of their effects with and without query directives. The goal is to better understand these topics and to hopefully stop using and perpetuating common mis-uses of terminology and common misconceptions about the technology.

## Title: It’s Time for a Change : Temporal Table Support in SQL Server 2016
 
**Abstract**:
Without temporal tables (AKA history tables), we can only see the current version of data. We can’t see rows that have been deleted or rows as they existed before the latest update. The temporal table support in SQL Server 2016 gives us the ability to create system maintained “history” tables to track all changes to the table data.

In this session we’ll discuss how you can benefit from temporal support in your tables, how to implement temporal tables in SQL Server 2016, and how to write “time travel queries” using the new FOR SYSTEM_TIME clause in a SELECT statement to easily query historical information.
