## Title: SQL Server Take Over:  Establishing a Baseline
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Take Over:  Establishing a Baseline

Performance assessment and tuning for the beginner DBA
 
Have you ever inherited a group of servers with not a lot of documentation to accompany them?   Do you have a lot of undocumented or new servers in your environment and you want to establish some baseline configuration setting prior to making changes? You need up to date information on the system very quickly. 
 
The server is running slowly... or is it? Slow compared to what?  Before you being digging into performance issues, there are some baseline metrics you should have established. Only after the information has been gathered, can a plan of attack be developed to help resolve issues with performance. Attendees in this session will learn how to quickly  gather information, review the results and get an action plan on the next step in performance tuning.

## Title: Power BI data preparation with Dataflows [VIDEO]
 
**Abstract**:
Data preparation is often the most labour-intensive component of an analytics project and getting this right is vital if the results are to be accurate. While the growth of self-service BI has empowered users to answer important questions, ensuring well managed data is available to all employees remains one of businesses biggest challenges. 
Dataflows is an extension of the Power BI ecosystem, providing a low code approach using Power Query to create curated datasets that can be easily consumed by business analysts, thereby improving the speed at which business value can be delivered. Dataflows provides a single-version-of-the-truth which was traditionally attained by building a data warehouse. 
You will learn
-How Dataflows can be used to create rich, vetted datasets
-How Dataflows can be created with the click of a button, ingesting data from many well knows SAAS solution such as Dynamics and Salesforce
-How to manage Dataflows using advanced data preparation tools such as Databricks

## Title: Tame Your Unruly Data With Constraints
 
**Abstract**:
Bad data comes in many forms: duplicate rows, wrong data type, invalid values, and orphaned or missing foreign keys. Time is wasted cleansing, reviewing and correcting data, not to mention the potential hazards bad data can cause. This introductory presentation will explain the data types and constraints available in SQL Server, and how they can replace or augment business rules that would otherwise be written in application or procedure code. Performance benefits provided by constraints will be demonstrated. We will examine the various system views and procedures that describe constraints and how to use them to document your databases. You will be able to apply this knowledge to your database environments and see significant improvements in data quality, performance, and reliability.

## Title: Uhms and Bunny Hands: Tips for Improving Your Presentation Skills
 
**Abstract**:
Are you considering becoming a speaker, but feel nervous about getting on stage for the first time? Have you already presented a few sessions and want advice on how to improve? Do you learn more from seeing examples of what you should NOT do during a presentation instead of reading a list of bullet points on how to become a better speaker?

Don't worry! I have made plenty of presentation mistakes over the years so you won't have to :)

In this session, we will go through common presentation mistakes and how you can avoid them, as well as how you can prepare for those dreaded worst-case scenarios. Don't let those "uhms" and "uhhs" dominate your presentation, help the audience focus on the key message you're delivering instead of making them read a wall of text in your slides, recover gracefully from any demo failures, and stop distracting your attendees with floppy bunny hands.

All it takes is a little preparation and practice. You can do this!

## Title: Intermediate Security Topics in SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
How many times have you been told by your customers:

* "just grant db_owner/sysadmin to my application and it will work"
* "I need to be able to issue raw DML against these tables"
* "my login doesn't work the way it should!"
* "this query that is accessing objects in multiple databases isn't working"

In this session, we'll talk about ways to service requests like these without
having to give away the world.  We’ll start with authentication and
authorization, for context.

We will then go into different methods to augment the "normal" means of
obtaining permissions that will allow you to help your customers while at the
same time not needing to be overly permissive.

 
In the course of this presentation, you'll learn about:

    * Module signing
    * Permission chaining
    * Impersonation
    and more!

## Title: T-SQL Habits and Practices That Can Kill Performance
 
**Abstract**:
All too often we are on a project or given a task where the time or financial constraints require us to develop T-SQL “quick-and-dirty”. Or maybe we have been tasked with quickly improving the performance of some existing T-SQL. These situations often lead to code that later needs to be tuned for better performance. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could satisfy those tight time constraints while also avoiding many of the pitfalls that later plague performance?
In this session we will see ten common T-SQL writing habits that contribute to poor performance. We’ll see WHY each of these patterns can have such negative impact on performance, including examples, and we’ll see one or more alternatives for each that don’t have the same negative impact.
Armed with this knowledge, you will definitely impress your boss with your ability to create fast T-SQL within tight time constraints, and also quickly fix existing T-SQL code. Enjoy the merit raise you’ll get due to your new tuning talents.

## Title: Building Your Own Power BI Image Generating Measures
 
**Abstract**:
With the August 2018 version of Power BI, you can now write DAX measures that generate dynamic chart images using the SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) standard. This means the long sought-after chart types of "small multiples" and "spark lines" are suddenly available, letting report authors create a sort of pivot table, not of numbers, but of dozens of tiny dynamic charts. However, this only works if you know how to leverage DAX to write dynamic SVG code, a rather oblique use of the language. In this session we'll be showing users how to do exactly that live on stage. We'll create several chart measures, from KPI indicators, to spark lines, to the game-changing bullet charts. Folks will walk away with some basic patterns they can use to create their own chart measures at home in no time at all.

## Title: Execution plans ... where do I start? [VIDEO]
 
**Abstract**:
SQL (the language) is not a third generation language, where the developer tells the computer every step it needs to take. It is a declarative language that specifies the required results. SQL Server itself will figure out what steps it takes to get to those results. Most of the time, that works very well.

But sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes a query takes too much time. You need to find out why, so you can fix it. That's where the execution plan comes in. In the execution plan, SQL Server exposes exactly which steps it took for your query, so you can see why it's slow.

However, execution plans can be daunting to the uninitiated. Especially for complex queries. Where do you even start?

In this session you will learn how to obtain execution plans. and how to start reading and understanding them.

## Title: Relational Data Architecture 101
 
**Abstract**:
This presentation is a quick introduction for the DBA or developer who was just told that their boss promised a major new customer a scalable, well designed database. The customer will pay a lot of cash and years of ongoing business using this database… If you deliver it this week!

You’ll get a big bonus if you build this right, but you also remember what your co-workers did to the person who bungled the last database design… and wonder if that designer ever recovered! This session will introduce you to the fundamentals of Datatypes, Relational Algebra, and Normalization to help you avoid the major pitfalls and maybe get some sleep too!

This presentation is a survey of Data Architecture for the Intermediate DBA, it is not intended for experienced Data Modelers.

## Title: DBA vNext
 
**Abstract**:
Not long ago, being a Microsoft DBA meant be specialized in Microsoft SQL Server and all the whistles and bells shipped together in the same box. That was the on-prem age.

Now in the cloud computing age, all cloud providers support multiple database engines in order to welcome all applications to their infrastructure. SQL Server is not always the way to go for an application.

In this session full of demos, we will discuss what it takes to be an all-rounded Azure cloud DBA, best applicable scenarios, price budgeting and tuning.

## Title: CozyRoc: Dynamic Data Flows in SSIS Without Programming
 
**Abstract**:
This session is an introduction to the unique functionality offered by COZYROC to create integration packages that dynamically map columns at runtime. The standard SSIS Data Flow Task can only use static metadata which is defined when the package is initially designed. The mapping of columns is configured and remains unchanged until the package is re-opened and design changes are made, thus costing maintenance time and effort. Data Flow Task Plus extends the capabilities of the standard Microsoft Data Flow task in that it allows you to set up dynamic data flows, thus eliminating maintenance time and effort. Changes to tables and columns are automatically incorporated at run time without the need to change and redeploy the package. Columns and fields are mapped automatically at run time. Furthermore, the initial design time and effort may be greatly reduced when dealing with huge amounts of data in a large number of files and/or databases.

## Title: Be Friendly to SQL Server with TSQL Best Practices [VIDEO]
 
**Abstract**:
TSQL is a necessity when interacting with SQL Server so knowing can be half the battle. Performance is always good as the database starts to grow, but building in resilience when you begin is a greater advantage than refactoring. I will go over 5 key things to know when you write TSQL, use DataTypes and/or variables in comparisons and you will also learn about the procedure cache and how to avoid pitfalls there. This is a beginners session but the concepts in this session are a great foundation to begin with. If you are looking for a solid foundation to build on and need the basics to start, this session is definitely for you.

## Title: Test Driven Development in SQL Server – how to deploy code safer [VIDEO]
 
**Abstract**:
Test Driven Development (TDD)  is a design approach which has enabled application developers to write cleaner code. It is relevant for database development as it ensures that code produced using TDD and unit tests will be of higher quality which means interactions with data will be safer. 

TDD is not a new method of unit testing, it is an essential design practice for improving the quality of your deployed code.

In this session it will be shown how we can use TDD to design and write better unit tests using open-source frameworks and industry standard tools. These tools can be run within SQL Server Management Studio which means DBAs can also take advantage of TDD and unit test, to ensure more reliable code is deployed to databases. 
TDD can result in code that can be deployed more reliably and faster when using DevOps processes such as Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. 

A comprehensive DEMO will reveal how Test Driven Development can help you deploy database code safer.

## Title: Data Testing  Integrity – BI Edition
 
**Abstract**:
Unit Testing and Test-Driven Development are common practices in application development.  In SQL development we’ve even got tSQLT! In the realm of BI with desperate systems, integration layers, data warehouses and even cubes we need a better approach.

In this session, we’ll discuss different problem scenarios and practical solutions. We’ll identify the need to look at the data from the business perspective and define specific integrity checks to ensure our data is accurate.  Then the fun part!  Using the Microsoft BI tool-set, we will walk-through a working solution demonstrating a way to efficiently centralize this process.  

At the end of the session, we’ll all still agree that we can’t use a unit test or record counts to ensure that data is accurate.  You will have a simple solution that you can start with to work in your environment and look at data testing  integrity differently.

## Title: Data Modeling and Prototyping in Power BI Desktop [VIDEO]
 
**Abstract**:
Power BI Desktop is often shown as a self-service reporting and analytics tool, but it can also be used earlier in the development cycle for prototyping and data modeling and can do it quicker and easier than other tools made for this purpose. In this session we will go through multiple examples showing how Power BI Desktop is the perfect tool to quickly model data from multiple data sources (including web sites, databases, cubes, online services and even flat files) perform quick actions to cleanse and connect these various sources to each other using M and DAX functions built-in to Power BI Desktop. Once this model has been built it can be used to create some quick reports to show how this will be used to help get a project approved/funded. Best of all using Power BI Desktop to do all of this is completely free to use, no licensing or Power BI login required!

## Title: Indexing for Beginners [VIDEO]
 
**Abstract**:
To a beginner, indexes may seem like magic. The right index can drastically reduce query time. But, how do you know which indexes are the right ones? SQL Server will suggest helpful indexes in the graphical execution plan and with the Database Engine Tuning Advisor, but follow that advice with caution. This session will explain how indexes work and how to tune indexes so that your application has the best performance.

## Title: Don't Use Cursors or Why You Maybe Should Use a Cursor After All
 
**Abstract**:
You might have heard "don't use cursors, they are slow!". In this presentation, you will learn what actually means: you should normally write set-based statements instead and I will explain why they generally are faster than writing your own loops. But I will also look at situations where using a loop for one reason or another is preferrable, and you will learn that the best way to run a loop in most cases is exactly a cursor, provided that you implement it properly. The presenation also gives some tips how you can troubleshoot performance problems with loops.

## Title: PowerShell for the DBA
 
**Abstract**:
PowerShell is a tool used by many people in DevOps and Infrastructure. Should the DBA get on board with using PowerShell? The answer is yes - as a DBA, PowerShell can have a significant impact on tasks that would be long and tedious with just T-SQL alone. Today there are specific modules that can be incorporated into PowerShell to help in automating every-day DBA tasks. Beyond that, PowerShell can be used to do things like automate deployments and audit permissions. 

In this session we will explore real-world examples and demonstrate how PowerShell can be leveraged by the DBA to not only improve efficiency but also streamline processes across an enterprise environment.
