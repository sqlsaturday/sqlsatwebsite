## Title: Hierarchies... on Steroids the No RBAR Way
 
**Abstract**:
Hierarchical data sets are everywhere. If you haven't worked with one yet, you will. If you're already working with them, you know they can be horribly complex, slow performing, difficult to maintain resource hogs that can really take the steam out of any GUI or batch process. This simple but code intensive "black arts" session shows you how to quickly and easily get around all of that using all 3 common hierarchical structures and a new structure that just might make Nested Sets obsolete. For stalwarts, it also includes a very high performance method (100,000 nodes in 6 seconds) for converting Adjacency Lists to Nested Sets that even a beginner can understand.  You just have to know that a Tally Table is involved somewhere in this. ;-)

## Title: Building Your Own SQL Server Virtual Playground
 
**Abstract**:
As the number of SQL Server versions and features grow over time so does the the difficulty in maintaining a set of tools for working with all of them on your local machine. Add in that some features require multiple physical instances and suddenly a single installation isn't enough. Need to quickly switch between versions and editions of SQL Server? Want to learn how to set up a cluster? Or maybe you want to try out the latest features in SQL 2012...virtualization offers a convenient way to do any or all of these. In this session we'll show you how by covering the fundamentals of desktop virtualization and demonstrating how to set up a virtual playground on your own machine.

## Title: Strategies for Sharding with SQL Azure Federations
 
**Abstract**:
Putting big data in the cloud is not without its difficulties and the Microsoft Azure teams have been consistently upping the resource limits that you are able to utilize within a given instance. Those of us with larger capacity instances still have to hedge our bets when looking at moving to the cloud. That is until the recent release of SQL Azure Federations, which offers a native SQL Azure based option to possible unlimited scalability. In this session, we will break down the basics of sharding within SQL Azure Federations, explain what needs to be taken into consideration in terms of database design, and put you on the right path to a successful Federation based deployment.

## Title: What Sequence objects are (and are not)
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2012 adds a new object to our arsenal called a sequence that can will give us the capability to implement automatically incrementing values. However, it cannot replace a lot of functionality that we have used a numbers table and windowing functions for (though they can be complimentary to one another). In this session I will demonstrate the uses and performance characteristics of sequences, including how they compliment the use of number tables and windowing functions to create surrogate key and sorting values, and more.

## Title: Administering the BI Stack
 
**Abstract**:
More often than not, a SQL DBA will also be requested (or required) to administer *other* applications in the SQL universe.  These applications are often the BI stack, SSIS, SSRS, and SSAS.  In this session, you will learn not only what each of these applications does, but also some behind the scenes views into how they work.  At the end of this session, you will have a better feeling of what to look for when something goes wrong, and have the knowledge to be proactive with your Business Intelligence implementations.

This session will focus on the SSIS, SSRS, and SSAS engines in this session.  Not a session for developers, we will be focusing on the ADMINISTRATION of these applications/services only.

## Title: Transactional Replication: Beyond The Basics
 
**Abstract**:
Transactional replication can support synchronizing from as few as a hundred to as many as hundreds of millions or more of changes a day across multiple servers. However, replication is more than clicking your way through wizards; Monitoring and tuning are required to achieve optimal performance and the number of processes involved increase the likelihood that problems can (and usually will) occur. This session is for DBA already familiar with the basics of transactional replication and looking to go beyond the setup wizards to gain a deeper understanding of the technology.  We'll cover monitoring techniques, calibrating performance, and troubleshooting common replication problems plus share some tricks and tips.

## Title: SQL Server Security for Developers
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server has a robust and granular system for granting and denying access to users, but all too often we see applications running as DBO or even sysadmin. Why? Part of is that same granular system can be overwhelming and part is that many developers don't see the point in applying such granular security. In this introductory level presentation we'll start at the beginning with creating and managing logins, take a quick look at system roles, and then get into the nitty gritty of users and roles and permissions at the database level. Along the way we'll talk about why its so important to set security at the database and not just rely on the application enforced security.

## Title: TempDB Performance Troubleshooting and Optimizing
 
**Abstract**:
Every SQL Server instance relies on the tempdb database. Whether through explicit use with #temp tables or @table variables, or implicit use through working space for many other operations, most tempdb databases get quite a workout. This session will dig into many of the otherwise-hidden issues that can kill server performance. After this session, you will be able to spot tempdb performance issues, drill into the causes, and take the steps necessary to solve them.

## Title: Shade Tree Mechanic's Guide to SSAS
 
**Abstract**:
This is a session for the SQL DBA that has SSAS in their environment, but is not sure what happens under the hood when it queried, much less how to tell if it's performing at its best. This is not a session on query optimization. But, this session will help you better understand if there is room for query optimization or if some basic configuration changes might provide that needed boost. We'll discuss the basic architecture of SSAS and cover some of the most pertinent metrics to give you a quick and easy view into your SSAS server's performance.

## Title: Communicate for Great Good!
 
**Abstract**:
“No one knows what I do.” That’s a chief complaint of data professionals everywhere, and it’s a dangerous position to be in as well. Reviews may not be favorable, promotions more uncommon, and training dollars more rare. But by practicing written and verbal communication, new opportunities may present themselves. Blogging can land a book deal. In-house team lunch-and-learns can lead to community presentations. Most of all, good communication can be the skill that saves your job or opens the door to new horizons.
