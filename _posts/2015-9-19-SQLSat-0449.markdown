## Title: Building Perfect SQL Servers, Every Time
 
**Abstract**:
One of the biggest challenges in any large SQL environment is maintaining consistent configurations and meeting the pressures from the business for rapid server deployments. Additionally by default, SQL Server does not install with the best practices for every environment. You will learn best practices for system settings, file system layout and scheduling maintenance tasks. You will learn about what the best practices are for most SQL Server configurations, and how to automate your SQL Server builds in both a physical and virtual world. You will learn about the tradeoffs and benefits to completely automating the build process. You were hear about lessons learned building a private cloud at a Fortune 100 telecommunications company. You will also learn how use these same methods to ensure consistency with your servers whether they are in the cloud, or on-premises.

## Title: The Database: The Elephant in the ALM Room
 
**Abstract**:
Many teams and individuals are still building their databases and maintaining them through old-fashioned manual processes. This, even as these same teams move towards an automated Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) through the adoption of DevOps best practices. These manual processes are hurting the ability of your database deployments to keep up with modern development. Is there a technical reason for this slow adoption of ALM best practices in the database world, or is there a cultural problem preventing a reassessment of these manual processes? Or, could it be both? This session will address these questions as it explores the challenges presented by ALM for databases. We will discuss the necessary first steps required to move from a manual database deployment process to a fully automated one. You will learn about tooling that can assist you in implementing these new processes. Your database deployments can take advantage of the same processes you use for application deployments.

## Title: A Masters Passport to Extended Events
 
**Abstract**:
As is commonly the case, all good things come to an end.  And now is as good a time as any for the use of SQL Trace and Profiler to come to an end.  Let’s face it, Trace was a good tool and had some wonderful uses.  Profiler for that matter was a good tool and was useful at times.
It is time to let those old tools retire gracefully and move into the world of XE.  This full day workshop will provide you the means to let Profiler and Trace be retired from your toolset as you discover all that XE has to offer.

This session on Extended Events will help prepare you to put this tool to immediate use as you walk back to your daily duties.  This workshop will teach you about Extended Events starting with the basics and moving through how to create XE sessions that will get the right data for you, while doing so with minimal impact.

## Title: Monster Text Manipulation: Regular Expressions for the DBA
 
**Abstract**:
Regular expressions can help you perform incredible tasks with very little effort.  Need to create 1700 logins from an email request? Developers give you a single script with 300 stored procedures filled with table variables instead of temp tables?  Need to move 500 databases to a different drive?  Any of these tasks can take a long time to code, but regular expressions cuts that work from hours to seconds.  I use regular expressions all the time and I have taken many tasks down from several days to just a few minutes.  Stop writing code manually and let regular expressions do it for you.
Here you’ll learn:
•	The most useful regular expression commands.
•	The appropriate times to use regular expressions.
•	How to use regular expressions to write code for you.
•	How to incorporate regular expressions into large tasks and combine them with other methods.

## Title: Understanding Parameter Sniffing
 
**Abstract**:
Parameter sniffing is a good thing: it is used by the Query Optimizer to produce an execution plan tailored to the current parameters of a query. However, due to the way that the plan cache stores these plans in memory, sometimes can also be a performance problem. This session will show you how parameter sniffing works and in which cases could be a problem. How to diagnose and troubleshoot parameter sniffing problems and their solutions will be discussed as well. The session will also include details on how the Query Optimizer uses the histogram and density components of the statistics object and some other advanced topics.

## Title: A NoSQL Primer for the SQL Server Developer
 
**Abstract**:
You have all probably heard about this "NoSQL" thing and wondered what is about, how does it differ from SQL Server and how will this affect me.  You might want to just stick your head in the sand and ignore it, but as database professionals it is always good to know about what other technologies might be out there to compliment your existing solutions.  We will not be going deep into any one solution, but by the end of this session, the goal will be that you understand the following:

1. The different types of NoSQL databases
2. Some use cases where they might be applicable
3. Some of the major solutions out there for each one

## Title: Silent Killers Lurking in Your Database Design
 
**Abstract**:
A good database design goes deeper than the rules that Codd gave us. We need to leverage SQL Server to help enforce these rules. In this class we’ll look at some common questions like: I have foreign keys, why do I need foreign key constraints too? Why are smart keys not so smart? If I use an identity field, do I still need to declare it as a primary key? The wrong answers to these questions can slow your queries down over time and even create bad data. Join me in my session as we look at demos to understand how silent killers can begin to lurk in your database.

## Title: But it worked great in Dev!  Perfomance for Devs
 
**Abstract**:
If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.
