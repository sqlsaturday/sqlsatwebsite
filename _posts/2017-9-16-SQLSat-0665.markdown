## Title: In-Memory Tables --Formula One Performance Unleashed, Part 1
 
**Abstract**:
Query performance is what it is all about.  SQL Server 2014/2016 now has the new in-memory functionality that takes a completely different approach to data access and manipulation.  This session will consolidate the relevant information from all these sources so the production DBA/Developer will be able to understand, create, use, maintain, and trouble-shoot in-memory table functionality.  This session will also examine several demo scripts showing performance gains using the in-memory tables with and without columnstore indexes over equivalent disk based tables.  
This session is all about when and how to apply in-memory tables in a production environment.
After this session you will
1.	 Understand what in-memory tables are and how to create and maintain them including their limitations
2.	Be able to identify performance gains over equivalent disk back tables
3.	Comprehend the new data monitoring needed for in-memory table

## Title: IoT Circus –  deathmatch oops, datematch :) Power Bi vs Time Series Insights
 
**Abstract**:
Or how to visualize your data and find insights for beginner IoT developer
If you create an IoT solution today, you have a variety of components available to mix and match to make your solution, akin LEGO.
You get your hardware and firmware right and you get data from the sensors, now what? Of course, you would like to have, some data visualization easy and fast, and of course you would like to learn something from that data easy and fast. And it would be nice to have the results available on mobile devices, yes, yes easy and fast.
Now enter our two titan technologies in a match to the death oops data  trying to achieve these goals, you guess it easy fast (and cheap). 
And we will see them clash, from real hardware, to the big Azure cloud, to mobile devices, trying to outmatch each other.

## Title: Third Party Tools for SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
During of my work in the field (for more than 17 years) I noticed that very few people are aware that SQL Server has a great ecosystem of partners that come with functionality where Microsoft tools don't do it, or don't go in depth. Even more, some of the are offered for free and my session will expose as many as possible.

## Title: PowerBI On-Premises Vs Cloud
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft initially released PowerBI online services which had restriction of developing dashboards and reports online only. Then came the PowerBI desktop for easy onsite development including the complex DAX logics.

PowerBI support to SQL Server 2016 Reporting Services is a major breakthrough for any dashboards without any need to host in the Cloud.

In this session, we will explore and compare the features availale on PowerBI Online Services and PowerBI On-prem SSRS 2016. This session also covers the PowerBI Roadmap for both on-prem and cloud solutions.
