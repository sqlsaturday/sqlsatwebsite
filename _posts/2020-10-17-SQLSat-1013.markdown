## Title: Handle Data with Care
 
**Abstract**:
Security, privacy, data leaks, industrial espionage are terms we hear on a daily basis. Are we aware of the potential dangers and potential consequences for our companies, customers and businesses? Before answering this question for yourself, check out the link entitled "World's Biggest Data Breaches  Hacks":
https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/
Data Breaches figures are generally measured in the tens and hundreds of millions of records. However, the other side of the medal from the Hall of Fame is that it is unprotected data from databases that have reached the "deep web". What happens next, hypothetically, can have very serious consequences. 
Is everything just so black? Learn about it on this session.

Patrick Gallucci will share a service delivery approach that helps organizations move large and small data platforms to Azure. He will show you how to leverage proven cloud adoption methodologies, tools, resources, and best practices to enable your organization to simplify and accelerate their move to the cloud.
