## Title: XML Without Xanax: How to Handle XML in SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Do you cringe whenever you have to look at an XML document? Does the very thought of XML data living in your database make you scream? Do you have a panic attack any time you have to parse XML? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then this session is for you!

We'll start with reasons why having XML in SQL Server might be a good thing, then we'll face our fears and turn tabular data into XML, and finally we'll confront the true source of our anxiety by parsing XML back into tabular data using xQuery.

If you survive this session, you'll have faced your fears about XML in SQL Server, you'll have a solid understanding of creating XML from tabular data, and you'll know how to use xQuery to parse XML.

## Title: PowerBI  Other Self Service BI tools: Where They Fit in the Enterprise.
 
**Abstract**:
Self-service BI tools such as Power BI and Tableau provide business users the ability to use their data when they need it – without relying heavily on IT.  Self-service BI tools speed up analysis, take strain off of IT for BI requests, and allow businesses to truly be more data driven.  Power BI or Tableau alone usually won't be complete BI solutions; they're designed to be pieces of a larger enterprise puzzle.  In this session Ross Parks, will talk about where Power BI stands in the market of self-service BI tools and how it can be utilized within an enterprise.  He will also demonstrate multiple implementation strategies for companies considering a self-service BI tool. Ross Parks has worked with several companies across with Wisconsin to implement self-service BI tools and will discuss his experiences as use-case examples.

## Title: Data Migration Using BIML
 
**Abstract**:
Many companies scale out their databases horizontally, partitioning data by customer (or some other identifier) into separate databases or instances.  Sometimes, it becomes important to move that data from one database to another.  SQL Server Integration Services is a fantastic tool for ETL, but creating and maintaining dozens or hundreds of data flows by hand is exhaustingly tedious.  Instead of doing it the hard way, use the BI Markup Language (BIML) to automate package development.  This talk will show how we can use metadata tables and BIML to auto-create SSIS packages to migrate data from one database to another, handling foreign key constraints along the way.

## Title: Anatomy of an Optimizer
 
**Abstract**:
In this session, we look in depth at how the query processor architecture and show what operations it performs during query optimization to generate equivalent query plans and find a “good enough” plan with limited time during query optimization, explain query optimization phases and show a few DMVs that are useful when diagnosing optimizer behavior
We will also explore the differences between In-Memory OLTP tables vs Disk based tables, and have a look at some considerations when you use the new cardinality estimator
We explain why query optimization complexity increases exponentially with the number of tables included in the plan, and how to diagnose and remedy issues that relate to bad query plans

## Title: Objective SQL Server Performance
 
**Abstract**:
“It’s slow! FIX IT!” is not a fun way to walk into the office on a Monday morning. However, putting objective metrics to the subjectivity of ‘slow’ is as much a science as it is art. Performance engineering takes effort well before an issue arises. Collecting the right metrics, trending and comparing against an established baseline, and identifying bottlenecks are all part of the performance process. This interactive session will help the DBA fine-tune their performance tuning approach so that the foundation for long-term proactive performance review is in place. The DBA can then shift the job responsibilities from a reactive response to a more predictive and proactive role.

## Title: Data Architecture 101
 
**Abstract**:
This presentation is a quick introduction for the DBA or developer who was just told that their boss promised a major new customer a scalable, well designed database. The customer will pay a lot of cash and years of ongoing business using this database… If you deliver it this week!

You’ll get a big bonus if you build this right, but you also remember what your co-workers did to the person who bungled the last database design… and wonder if that designer ever recovered! This session will introduce you to the fundamentals of Datatypes, Relational Algebra, and Normalization to help you avoid the major pitfalls and maybe get some sleep too!

This presentation is a survey of Data Architecture for the Intermediate DBA, it is not intended for experienced Data Modelers.

## Title: SQL Server Hybrid Cloud Strategy: Best Of Both Worlds With On-Prem + Cloud
 
**Abstract**:
For years it seemed that the only message SQL Server professionals were hearing was "to the Cloud.... you must get to the Cloud!". However, if you work in a highly regulated industry, or one simply averse to change, this likely was not an option for you. The good news is, Microsoft heard your feedback and has been busy incorporating Cloud connectivity, compatibility, and functionality into the box product.

Come spend the hour with me and you’ll learn how to leverage the power of the Cloud with your on-premises SQL Server install. We’ll cover backup and restore options with Windows Azure Storage, using Windows Azure VMs for high availability, how to store your data files in Windows Azure Storage, and more.  We’ll start with SQL Server 2012 and work our way up to the most recently released bits for SQL Server 2016.  You can have the best of both worlds with a SQL Server Hybrid Cloud strategy!

## Title: Enterprise Auditing with SQL Server Audit
 
**Abstract**:
Audit. The very word strikes fear in the bravest of hearts. But as a DBA, the need to know who is doing what in your production databases is critical.  In SQL Server 2008, Microsoft finally gave us a true auditing tool. But how does it work, what exactly can it track, and how can you handle its output? 

In this session, we cover SQL Server Audit from the ground up. We go from the basics of which events can be audited to a look at how SQL Server Audit works "under the covers", and what that means for performance. While implementing server and database audits, we discuss audit granularity and filtering, as well as the pros and cons of Audit's output options.

Whether it's through the SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) interface, via T-SQL, or using PowerShell and Server Management Objects (SMO), at the end of this session you'll be able to deploy SQL Server Audit across your enterprise and manage its output, fearlessly.

## Title: Automating Your Database Deployments
 
**Abstract**:
Deploying your database changes to production can be nerve-wracking as you introduce changes while attempting to protect your data. In order to take the stress out of these deployments, you must ensure that you practice your deployments before you ever get near production. This session shows how automating the deployment and testing processes through your various development and pre-production environments can make the whole experience of production deployments more repeatable, more reliable and more robust.

In this session, we'll explore the concepts of continuous integration and continuous delivery for databases – what to consider, the challenges, the benefits, the testing, and the crucial approval gates necessary for a reliable production deployment. We'll discuss these and other release strategies as you think about how to evolve your deployment pipeline towards a more automated approach, starting with continuous integration and ending at your production systems.

## Title: "I Love Replication"...Something Rarely if Ever Said By DBAs But Should Be
 
**Abstract**:
As luck would have it you need to get data from point A to point B on a regular basis so someone suggests replication.  Many things run through your mind like maybe I could deliver the data myself I have a few thumb drives, “who is the DBA anyway?”and then finally which replication model and which type would be best to fit our needs?  This talk will go over all replication options available in SQL Server along which the many of the pitfalls and gotchas you should be aware of before setting things up. An outline of steps and processes to put in place once replication has been set up to maintain and monitor the publication will also be provided.

## Title: Living and Dying by Dynamic SQL
 
**Abstract**:
Ask any DBA if they want to manage dynamic SQL: "Impossible-to-read source code and SQL injection? No thanks!" they'll say. However, dynamic SQL not a tool of the desperate and unskilled. It is flexible and makes complex queries screaming fast when more conventional methods cannot. In this session, we focus on:
* Understanding pros and cons of dynamic SQL
* Writing fast and efficient dynamic SQL code
* Monitoring dynamic SQL statements and their performance

To spark discussion and keep the audience riveted, this session is styled as a technical presentation weaved into an interactive murder mystery, complete with suspects, interrogations, and clues. Attendees form small groups to observe, discuss, and ultimately solve the mystery of the deadly dynamic SQL.

## Title: Working with Object Compression in SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2008 introduced object compression to the DBA toolkit. We all know there are different kinds of compression available in SQL Server. What you might not know boils down to some subtleties of compression. For example, not all page compressed objects are entirely page compressed. Many pages can be uncompressed or just row-compressed.
 
This session shows you how to reach into the database and discover compression states at the page level. At the lower level, this session also shows how to determine compression settings of objects in the database. You can use both some undocumented and more commonly known commands to derive some interesting information from the database engine.

## Title: Surviving a Technical SQL Interview
 
**Abstract**:
At some point every SQL interview is going to get technical.  This session will go through my favorite questions as an interviewer and talk about their overall relevance and answers.  We'll talk about how to handle the situations where you aren't sure of the answer - or when you know that you don't know the answer  The questions will cover database design, DBA, SSIS and SSRS aspects of SQL server. Pointers to resources will also be given.

## Title: "R" You Ready For SQL 2016?
 
**Abstract**:
R is one of the fastest growing programming languages, useful for data analysis and visualization. You've been able to connect to SQL databases to work with large data sets before using R packages. But now, with the upcoming SQL 2016 release, R will be included as an Advanced Analytics Extension. You'll be able to run the same R scripts right in your database. 

In this beginner session we will look at how to set up R on your SQL instance. We'll work with some sample data to show how R works with SQL inside and outside the database with some basic R commands. And we'll create some graphs and charts for use in some SSRS reports.

## Title: Everyday Extended Events
 
**Abstract**:
As a DBA or developer, you want to know what is happening inside SQL Server. Extended Events are the modern framework for finding and interpreting SQL Server's actions. In this session, you'll see practical examples to solve everyday problems, such as capturing queries and their resources, measuring wait statistics, tracking I/O for database files, and deadlocks. Many useful features will be shown, such as the depth of events, filtering, and multiple target types!

## Title: Why do I need Analysis Services?
 
**Abstract**:
Do you write a lot of SSRS reports with SQL queries or stored procedures? Have you heard about analysis services but don't know if it's a good fit for you? Are you trying to decide whether you should go with Tabular or OLAP? Are you thinking about using Power BI? In this session Phillip will go over use cases for Analysis Services and highlight the differences and strengths of each flavor of SSAS. If you have a data warehouse and aren't using SSAS come learn how SSAS will make your users love you.

## Title: Minimize Data Loss with Advanced Restore Methods 
 
**Abstract**:
Data loss can strike any server at any time. Are you prepared for the inevitable? A good DBA takes regular backups and practices regular restores; a great DBA has advanced restore techniques planned and tested. In this session, I will demonstrate three advanced restore methods that can make you a great DBA - point-in-time restores, page restores, and piecemeal restores, and will discuss the appropriate situations when each should be considered. Attend this session to better protect your business and your job.

## Title: Uncovering Duplicate, Redundant,  Missing Indexes
 
**Abstract**:
Do you design your database's indexes? Well, have you ever analyzed how those indexes are being used, if at all? And do you know if SQL Server needs other indexes to improve performance? Attend this session and discover how SQL Server tracks actual index usage. We will use this data to identify wasteful, unused,  redundant indexes. Finally, we will dive into the Missing Index DMV and learn how to make proper use of its recommendations. We will spend the second half of this session interactively working through a demo exercise, to reinforce the entire process.
