## Title: CozyRoc: Dynamic Data Flows in SSIS Without Programming
 
**Abstract**:
This session is an introduction to the unique functionality offered by COZYROC to create integration packages that dynamically map columns at runtime. The standard SSIS Data Flow Task can only use static metadata which is defined when the package is initially designed. The mapping of columns is configured and remains unchanged until the package is re-opened and design changes are made, thus costing maintenance time and effort. Data Flow Task Plus extends the capabilities of the standard Microsoft Data Flow task in that it allows you to set up dynamic data flows, thus eliminating maintenance time and effort. Changes to tables and columns are automatically incorporated at run time without the need to change and redeploy the package. Columns and fields are mapped automatically at run time. Furthermore, the initial design time and effort may be greatly reduced when dealing with huge amounts of data in a large number of files and/or databases.

## Title: Using Open Source Software to Collect Performance Metrics
 
**Abstract**:
Ever had a manager standing over your shoulder, wanting to know why an instance is running slow or if it can handle additional workload? If only you knew what performance metrics to collect and had them for your existing instances to answer these questions.

In this session, we will discuss sp_whoisactive and Query Store to track what queries are running. Then we will be combining three open source tools – Telegraf, InfluxDB, and Grafana – into an inexpensive and easy to set up system that collects performance metrics you can use to troubleshoot issues and answer important questions about your SQL Server instances, including your Linux SQL Server instances, Azure Managed Instances and Azure SQL Databases. 

Attendees will see how easy it is to get good performance data and visualize it interactively and combine with other tools to troubleshoot issues. Finally, we will look at problem I solved using this solution as an example.

## Title: SQL DevOps Simplified with Production Databases
 
**Abstract**:
DevOps is based on building an application binary (immutable artifact) that supports a highly reliable, repeatable engineering process.  In the case of SQL Server, however, a database is already in production, and isn’t simply replaced (as an app binary), but is upgraded.   Current SQL Server DevOps methods use source control to build a “development” database, with schema and objects and static data needed for functional testing.  "Near production data" is used in Staging, and finally production is upgraded.  This approach involves complexity, and breaks the principle of working with immutable artifacts throughout the process.  Our session introduces a new approach to SQL Server DevOps, with production databases used in all stages.   Production database clones are delivered more quickly than "built" databases, are more easily integrated with source control, and produces higher fidelity outcomes.  Learn how leading enterprises are simplifying SQL DevOps.

## Title: Using Azure Data Factory Mapping Data Flows to load Data Vault
 
**Abstract**:
Data Flow as a data transformation engine has been introduced to the Microsoft Azure Data Factory (ADF) last year as a private feature preview. This privacy restriction has been lifted during the last Microsoft Build conference in 2019 and Data Flow feature has become a public preview component of the ADF.

There are many different use-case scenarios that can be covered by Data Flows, considering that Data Flows in SQL Integration Service (SSIS) projects are still playing a big role to fulfill Extracting-Loading-Transforming (ETL) patterns for your data.

In this session, I will share my experience of populating a Data Vault repository by using Data Flows in Azure Data Factory.

## Title: Managing ETL Change Using BIMLScript
 
**Abstract**:
Change is constant, especially with source files. Health care claims data files change at least yearly. You develop an SSIS package to load the source file. You meticulously identify each of the columns and map them to the targets. Your package runs fine for months. Then the file format changes. Again, you tediously select each column, etc. Wouldn't it be nice to simply document the structure of the file, the file's metadata, and generate the SSIS from that metadata? Your users demand the documentation anyway. If the file changes, you simply change the metadata. 

To demonstrate such an approach, I import some US census data. I create the SSIS package using BIMLScript and metadata. When the format changes, I change the metadata and generate a whole new package. And if your whole ETL approach changes to say Azure Data Factory? I will demonstrate how to generate an Azure Data Factory pipeline from the same metadata.

## Title: Encrypting Data within SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Data breaches abound! Do you want to keep your company out of the headlines? What are some of the data privacy laws affecting you? How will encrypting data affect your database performance? What data fields should you encrypt?  What else can you do to protect your sensitive data?
 
In this session, we will review each option to encrypt data within SQL Server, Transparent Data Encryption, Cell Level Encryption and Always Encrypted. While we look at the encryption options, we will review both on-premise and cloud offerings.  This session will deep dive into setting up Always Encrypted encryption and share experiences implementing the encryption.   
 
You will leave this session with a deeper understanding about SQL Server encryption options and how encryption can affect your performance.  Also, you will gather information on how to fully protect and review your sensitive data usage.

## Title: Learn Like Your Life Depends On It
 
**Abstract**:
You have read this far, great!  I already know this session is for you. How do I know? It is exceedingly rare that today’s “9-5” job provides anywhere near what is needed to develop the career you want to have.  For the purposes of this session it does not matter if you are a newly minted, “wet behind the ears” data professional or a grizzled veteran.  What does matter is that you know that you have a career oriented mindset and a desire to grow beyond what you are today.

This session is designed to help with just that. In addition to talking about a learning plan that fits your needs, we will discuss how to execute that plan, including lab environments, as well as resources to help you execute those plans.  If you have reached this point, you simply need to be in this session, see you there.

## Title: “Black Arts” Index Maintenance #2: Better Methods that Can Actually Prevent Fragmentation for Weeks.
 
**Abstract**:
This isn’t your typical presentation on Index Maintenance.

In this 2nd of two back-to-back sessions, we’ll learn the 5 main “Insertion Patterns” and how they cause or prevent fragmentation, introduce the additional page splitting/fragmenting horror of “ExpAnsive Updates”, continue to learn about the true costs of using REORGANIZE and why it should be avoided, how it all affects performance and disk/memory usage, how it all affects Index Maintenance, and steps that can be taken to seriously improve all of that. 

We'll also learn that simply reducing Fill Factors isn't the "fix" for fragmentation and can actually cost you serious amounts of additional totally wasted memory while providing little to no value.

Unfortunately, there won’t be time to cover it all but well documented code will be provided to help identify the sources of page splits and “ExpAnsive Updates” so that they can be eliminated.

Session #1 is a strongly recommend prerequisite for this session.

## Title: Infrastructure for the DBA: An Introduction
 
**Abstract**:
It doesn’t matter if you are a Junior DBA, an accidental DBA or all the way up to a Senior DBA, the infrastructure your SQL Server environment runs on is important.  Many among the DBA community came in as developers or perhaps directly into database administration roles it is equally possible that you have been out of the operations world long enough to have fallen out of the loop with what is happening.  This session is intended to provide a full stack infrastructure overview so that you can talk shop with your cohorts in operations to resolve issues and maybe even be proactive.  We will discuss, in an introductory fashion, hardware, network, storage, virtualization and operating system layers.  Additionally, some suggestions as to where to find more information will be provided.

## Title: Power BI: From Zero to 101
 
**Abstract**:
Power BI is one of the leading Microsoft's BI technologies today and because its share is steadily grows on the job market, every IT professional and especially these, who work with data, should know at least basics of it. But what do YOU know about it? Do you know that Power BI provides very cool reports with dynamic diagrams on very beautiful dashboards? Do you know that you can feed to Power BI almost any types of data? Do you know that you can run Power BI on premise as weel as Power BI Service in the cloud? What else do you know about Power BI? Just several months ago I knew only those basics and despite of Power BI being very visual it was not easy to learn new technology. I still know only the basics, which should help me to deliver that session to the audience without going very deep. However, those basics are already enough to build really powerful Power BI dashboards. I'll share my practical knowledge in demos, will tell you about problems I've had and how I overcome them.

## Title: Scalable Application Design with Service Broker
 
**Abstract**:
How your business applications interact with the corporate database directly can have a dramatic impact on how successful you are, and one of the biggest issues is performance with large databases.  By designing the application to use asynchronous messaging for non-critical updates you can focus performance concerns to where the timeliness is critical.  SQL Server Service Broker handles the asynchronous requests quickly and efficiently, and minimizes the conflicts with your critical updates.  This session will walk you through the steps to get Service Broker up and running and providing a consistent delivery of your business data.

Learning Objectives:
Session Goal 1    Understand the Service Broker architecture
Session Goal 2    Understand the difference between critical and non-critical updates
Session Goal 3    Demonstrate how the non-critical updates are best handled asynchronously

## Title: Data Time Travel with SQL Server Temporal Tables
 
**Abstract**:
Many times developers have to support users by answering the “What happened to the data?”  The task of retrieving data from a specific point in time is not an easy one.  Often this involves retrieving a backup and restoring the data in question (hopefully!).  SQL Server 2016 introduced Temporal Tables, allowing a developer to retrieve data from a specific point in time, without backups.  With a few TSQL commands a historical table can be created, automatically updated, and readily accessed.

## Title: “Black Arts” Index Maintenance #1: How the “Best Practice” Methods are Silently Killing Performance
 
**Abstract**:
This isn’t your typical presentation on Index Maintenance.

In this 1st of two back-to-back sessions, we'll learn how the current “Best Practice” Methods are actually a leading cause of perpetual logical and physical fragmentation, totally unnecessary wasted memory/disk space, costly/continuous “Bad” page splits, unexplainable blocking, comparatively insane amounts of log file generation and, in an interesting “Catch 22”, a major part of why we have to do so much index maintenance and how it all negatively impacts your code even if it’s perfect code.

We'll also discover the true costs of page splits, how REORGANIZE can perpetuate them, their effect on performance, introduce and learn how to use "sp_IndexDNA™" to see indexes as you've never seen them before, and introduce methods to make even active GUID-based indexes 100% fragmentation free for months at a time, which will also fix the problems we’ve discovered.

This 1st session is also a recommended segue into the second session.

## Title: Introduction to M (a.k.a Power Query)
 
**Abstract**:
When it comes to getting your data into Excel or Power BI, M is your best choice. The M Language (A.K.A Power Query) is a powerful tool for self-service data preparation. However, it's not clear where it fits compared to tools like SSIS or TSQL. It's also not clear what it's limitations are. This session will cover the basics of M and when to use it.

In this session, we'll demonstrate how M is a linear series of transformations, just like a set of steps from a recipe. We'll show how 80% of what you will ever need to do can be done from the GUI. We'll also talk about how to write custom code for that other 20%. By the end of this presentation, you'll be able to take any manual cleanup you do today and turn it into a repeatable process with M.

## Title: How to do a Complete SQL Server Assessment
 
**Abstract**:
Completing a full assessment on a SQL Server is essential to learning about not only the current state of the server, but also any area that may be impacting performance or security.  If you have more than one DBA, it is also important to have all the DBA team members review the same areas when completing an assessment.  During this session we will discuss when assessments are useful, what should be included in the assessment as well as how to interpret the results.  We will use a SQL script that will capture all the data needed.  This script will more than 88 data points, including fragmentation of indexes, performance counter values, server and database security information, queries that consume the most CPU time including execution plans as well as many other data points. This session will also cover how to document your findings and recommendations.

## Title: Columnstore Indexes for Everyone
 
**Abstract**:
Columnstore indexes are available to all SQL Server editions, Express to Enterprise, starting with SQL Server 2016 Service Pack 1. They can save disk space, increase query performance, and combine OLTP and OLAP workloads. Should you change all your tables to columnstores? Let's find out!

## Title: Ethics, Morals, and Laws for the DBA 101
 
**Abstract**:
Ethics, Morals, and Laws each govern one aspect of our behavior as people and DBAs. They govern which actions we take and which actions we avoid.

Understanding the basics of these guides and how they coordinate (and sometimes conflict) with each other helps you to make choices you can live with from both a personal and professional perspective.

This session presents basic definitions, ideas, and discussion points. It is intended to be an interactive presentation where the audience contributes to the discussion, so no two presentations are exactly the same!

## Title: Faster SSIS
 
**Abstract**:
Ever wonder why SSIS runs so slowly? Watch SSIS author Andy Leonard as he runs test loads using sample and real-world data, and shows you how to tune SQL Server 2016 Integration Services (SSIS 2016) packages.

We'll start by experimenting with SSIS design patterns to improve performance loading AdventureWorks data. We will implement different change detection patterns and compare execution performance for each. Then, we'll explain a Data Flow Task's bottleneck when loading binary large objects - or Blobs. 

Finally, we'll demonstrate a design pattern that uses a Script Component in a Data Flow to boost load performance to MySql, whether on-premises or in the cloud.

## Title: When to use Indexing ProTools
 
**Abstract**:
Using the right index for the right scenario can be the "go fast" button that keeps queries and customers happy. 

Over the years, Microsoft has given us many different indexing options and flavors. Today there are many more considerations beyond "clustered or non clustered". We'll cover all those different flavor options: Filtered, Compressed, Columnstore, included columns, and Partitioning. 

We won't only talk about what these options are, we'll also cover how and when to use these different indexing options, and how to make sure you have enough--but not too many--indexes for your workload.

## Title: Azure SQL DB Managed Instance: Today
 
**Abstract**:
It has been about a year since Azure SQL DB Managed Instance has been released. What is it? Where does it fit? What limitations does it have? What has changed? What changes should I see next?  These questions will be addressed and more.  Will we see Managed Instance in action? We can, but it is just SQL Server presented in a different wrapper.  Along with Managed Instance, a discussion of Serverless and Hyperscale options will also be included.

**Abstract**:
Microsoft says Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed, multi-model database.  Your reaction might be something like, “what the heck is it”, “why would I use it”, or “how do I use it”.  The fundamental purpose of this session is to answer those very questions.  After briefly discussing what CosmosDB is, we’ll take some time to discuss why you might use CosmosDB instead of SQL Server or another platform, and finally touch on some basics to get you started with CosmosDB.  Upon completion of this session you will be better equipped to discuss the value of CosmosDB to your organization.
