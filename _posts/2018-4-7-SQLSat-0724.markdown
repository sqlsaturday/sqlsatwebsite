## Title: Accelerating Development and Testing Using Data Virtualization
 
**Abstract**:
Constraining everything in development and testing is database size.  Storage is a bottleneck, and while faster SSD/Flash is available, it is still too expensive due to the size of many databases, especially in DEV and TEST.  More to the point, it takes a lot of time to push terabytes around, and time itself is expensive.  The old joke about "good, fast, and cheap -- pick any two" is so true with data.

Providing full databases for each developer or tester on each task of each project seems unrealistic, when each copy might require terabytes of storage, so for decades everyone has limited themselves to working in shared dev/test environments that are refreshed only every few months, where conflicts occur,  quality suffers, and things move slowly.

Come learn why data virtualization is the solution to a problem everyone knows.

Good, fast, and cheap -- have all three with data virtualization.  Be able to clone data quickly, and remove the biggest constraint to development and testing.

## Title: Analysis Services for the Absolute Beginner
 
**Abstract**:
Publications across the globe have called “data the new oil.”  However, the value of oil is what the oil can be turned into.  Similarly, the value in data is in what you derive from it, not the data itself.

Regardless of the title you carry, DBA, developer, report writer, ETL developer, manager etc., now is the time to make an acquaintance of Analysis Services.  Come, join in as we define basic terms, investigate a few uses cases and see some simple examples.  You will soon see that if data is the new oil, Analysis Services, on-premises or in the cloud, is a key component in the new refinery.

## Title: Building the HASSP: Putting SQL Server In Space
 
**Abstract**:
In today's world, technology is a pervasive part of our lives. We have "smart" appliances everywhere: from cars, thermostats, and even refrigerators contain built-in systems to collect, store, and transmit data. Small embedded devices can also be used for scientific purposes as well, offering new and exciting ways to collect data for studies or projects at home.

The High-Altitude SQL Server Project, or HASSP, is one such project.

The HASSP team has created a high-altitude balloon that uses sensors to collect various data points and store the results in an embedded version of SQL Server!

In this session, you'll hear about how this is possible: we'll discuss the hardware used, the custom device that we built, and the software used to make it all work together. Best of all, you'll see how to recreate (and hopefully improve!) the project on your own.

## Title: Targeting Wait Statistics with Extended Events and DMVs
 
**Abstract**:
When troubleshooting overall server performance, wait statistics are a great place to start. But when your SQL Server hosts a complex set of workloads, it can be difficult to narrow down which queries are causing the most wait, and what types of wait they are causing. Fortunately, SQL Server provides easy ways for targeting which queries are causing you the most wait time. In this session, we’ll learn how to use both Extended Events, and Dynamic Management Views new to SQL Server 2016 for examining wait statistics at a query level, rather than at the server level. We’ll analyze poorly performing queries using a combination of methods and show how to quickly narrow down what SQL Server is waiting for, and why.

## Title: Locks, Blocks, and Snapshots: Maximizing Database Concurrency
 
**Abstract**:
The ability for multiple processes to query and update a database concurrently has long-been a hallmark of database technology, but this feature can be implemented in many ways. This session will explore the different isolation levels supported by SQL Server and Azure SQL Database, why they exist, how they work, how they differ, and how In-Memory OLTP fits in. Demonstrations will also show how different isolation levels can determine not only the performance, but also the result set returned by a query. Additionally, attendees will learn how to choose the optimal isolation level for a given workload, and see how easy it can be to improve performance by adjusting isolation settings. An understanding of SQL Server's isolation levels can help relieve bottlenecks that no amount of query tuning or indexing can address - attend this session and gain Senior DBA-level skills on how to maximize your database's ability to process transactions concurrently.

## Title: Power BI Bookmarks: Four Business Use Cases
 
**Abstract**:
So you've gathered the requirements, made sure the ETL is perfect, the model queries in milliseconds, and the report is both functional AND fashionable. There's always that one person(and usually a few) that wants to see the data with a different visual, or with filters applied a certain way. In this session, we will go in depth on the bookmarking feature in a live demo using the framework of four business cases. 

Power BI Pagination
	I'll take an existing dataset previously used for a SSRS report and add Page forward and backward buttons to it in Power BI
Change and Reset ALL filters and slicers
	I'll reset/update filters and slicers across multiple tabs in a report with a single button
Swapping out visuals with one click
	The director wants to see the visual but the VP wants to see the table
Executive Presentation
	Create a finely tuned presentation with nothing but Power BI

Bring your own dataset and build out these scenarios with me as I demonstrate each one live from scratch.

## Title: Three Steps to Lasting Encryption
 
**Abstract**:
You’ve encrypted your data! You’ve used the latest techniques. It’s strong. It’s safe. You’re done, right? Not so fast. Encryption gets weaker with age - keys are lost, algorithms are cracked, techniques become obsolete. In time, the system breaks down, rendering your data either irretrievable or unprotected.

To keep your encryption at full strength, you need to add three practices to your regular maintenance schedule. First, backup your keys frequently and securely to ensure you can always retrieve the data you’ve encrypted. Second, rotate your keys regularly to limit your exposure due to a lost or compromised key. Third, add an encryption key management solution (like Azure Key Vault) to make managing large numbers of keys easier or to enable someone else to manage the keys. In this session, we’ll discuss how you can implement each of these practices in your own environment.

## Title: Data Testing  Integrity – BI Edition
 
**Abstract**:
Unit Testing and Test-Driven Development are common practices in application development.  In SQL development we’ve even got tSQLT! In the realm of BI with desperate systems, integration layers, data warehouses and even cubes we need a better approach.

In this session, we’ll discuss different problem scenarios and practical solutions. We’ll identify the need to look at the data from the business perspective and define specific integrity checks to ensure our data is accurate.  Then the fun part!  Using the Microsoft BI tool-set, we will walk-through a working solution demonstrating a way to efficiently centralize this process.  

At the end of the session, we’ll all still agree that we can’t use a unit test or record counts to ensure that data is accurate.  You will have a simple solution that you can start with to work in your environment and look at data testing  integrity differently.

## Title: Practical Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever wondered how an AI solution is built?  In this session we will demystify the process and walk through how machine learning can be applied to solve a real-world problem. 

Starting from a multi-year dataset of thousands of mechanical devices, we’ll review and explain the steps it took to build a machine learning model that is able to predict when a device is about to fail.  Specifically we’ll cover: 
* What is AI and Machine Learning?
* Defining the problem
* Feature Engineering
* Model Selection
* Model Training and Evaluation
* Production Considerations

While the use case we will cover was implemented in R, our focus will be on the overall process so you can take what you’ve learned an apply it to your toolset of choice.  You’ll leave with a better understanding what AI is and how machine learning works.

## Title: Data Vault 2.0 An Introduction To A Better Data Warehouse Database Designing Method
 
**Abstract**:
As Dan Linstedt, the creator of Data Vault 2.0, describes it as follows:
The Data Vault Model is a detail oriented, historical tracking and uniquely linked set of normalized tables that support one or more functional areas of business. It is a hybrid approach encompassing the best of breed between 3rd normal form (3NF) and star schema. The design is flexible, scalable, consistent and adaptable to the needs of the enterprise.
Data Vault 2.0 is not an app but a database modeling methodology that overcomes many of the shortcoming of DW warehouse modeling. Data vault attempts to solve the problem of dealing with change in the environment by separating the business keys from the descriptive attributes of those keys. This class will go over the basic parts of the Data Vault 2.0 model along with examples of each.

## Title: Why Should I Care About ... Partitioned Views?
 
**Abstract**:
Partitioned tables are awesome and partitioned views are dead, right? Well, sure partitioned views are not sexy but there are still plenty of applications where they are critical. And not necessarily just for standard edition who aren't on the new service pack yet. If your data is time stamped, do you see different queries run against older data than new data? Do you with you could segment your data across multiple columns? Do you have data you need to partition horizontally? It's possible partitioned views may still be for you. Come hear why this is still an important topic long after cargo pants and trucker hats went away ... and possibly even after 2016 SP1.

## Title: XML vs JSON - Battle Royale
 
**Abstract**:
Shiny new touch bar MacBook Pro under one arm, JSON strolls in with a coffee from that new place with the ethically sourced beans. Grizzled XML looks up from an old ThinkPad and grunts, remembering that the stained company mug on the cluttered desk had been empty for some time. JSON was sure to be assigned the new web features while XML would be spending another week on those legacy third party integrations...

SQL Server 2016 brings JSON support, but does that mean XML is old news? Which has more features? Do they matter? Which is faster?

We'll review the many similarities and highlight some important differences between SQL Server 2016's XML and JSON support. You'll leave equipped to make the right choice for your environment.

## Title: When Low-Quality Data Strikes: Fuzzy Tools Provide Clarity in Matching and Deduplication
 
**Abstract**:
You have a high-quality dataset, appropriately keyed, groomed, and trusted by business users. Then you're asked to merge in a new, low-quality dataset. It may contain a different key structure, numerous text fields with typos, or optional fields that are empty on most records. How would you find as many accurate matches as possible? You can define multiple matching algorithms to handle the various discrepancies you find, but it can be difficult and time consuming to prevent missing matches.
In this session, I will showcase how you can solve problems like this using the fuzzy tools natively available in SQL Server. I will explain how a fuzzy approach compares to other options such as exact match algorithms, weighing the pros and cons. Finally, I will demonstrate how to set up the groundwork to incorporate fuzzy tools into a data flow solution. By the end of this session, you should have another tool in your toolbelt that can aid you in any matching or data deduplication scenario.

## Title: COZYROC: Dynamic Data Flows in SSIS without Programming
 
**Abstract**:
This session is an introduction to the unique functionality offered by COZYROC to create integration packages that dynamically map columns at runtime. The standard SSIS Data Flow Task can only use static metadata which is defined when the package is initially designed. The mapping of columns is configured and remains unchanged until the package is re-opened and design changes are made, thus costing maintenance time and effort. Data Flow Task Plus extends the capabilities of the standard Microsoft Data Flow task in that it allows you to set up dynamic data flows, thus eliminating maintenance time and effort. Changes to tables and columns are automatically incorporated at runtime without the need to change and redeploy the package. Columns and fields are mapped automatically at runtime. Furthermore, the initial design time and effort may be greatly reduced when dealing with huge amounts of data in a large number of files and/or databases.

## Title: In memory database... Let's rethink that request!
 
**Abstract**:
Many times users or management ask for something that they've heard about but don't quite understand, in hope of solving a problem that doesn't quite make sense. It is possible to put a SQL Server database in memory, and memory is faster than disk, so this has just got to be a good idea!

This session looks at what you can do to put a database in memory, at what problems that can help, and at what problems it won't affect noticeably. It also looks at the recommended way to put tables into memory and the problems that will solve.

## Title: DEA (not what you think) Will Be Your New Best Friend!
 
**Abstract**:
Database Experimentation Assistant (DEA) is Microsoft's new tool to help you collect, replay, and analyze a production workload against several configurations of SQL Server to compare performance. It even provides graphs of queries that performed worse after a change so that you can revisit those before making your change! Microsoft PFE, Jared Karney, will show you how to install, configure, and run this new tool and demonstrate how easy it can make your future upgrades and configuration changes.

**Abstract**:
Are you interested in learning how to leverage Azure Functions to create an app that can scale to demand? 

In this session, we will walk through the architecture and components of creating an Azure-facing video processing application that can scan videos for text and provide that information in CSV files for analysis. We will cover the architecture, data flow, and Azure technology pieces including Azure Functions, Blob Storage, Storage Queues, Azure Data Lake Storage  Analytics, and Power BI.

## Title: Custom Activities in Azure Data Factory
 
**Abstract**:
There are a lot of impressive out of the box capabilities with Azure Data Factory. Also, just like in SSIS, you can extend these capabilities using custom code (.Net in V1 or any executable in V2). We’ll discuss the prerequisites for Azure needed to implement these activities, as well as step through some code examples in C#, including how to setup your development environment. Prior experience with Azure Data Factory is highly recommend for this session.

## Title: Columnstore 101: The Five Ws of Columnstore Indexes
 
**Abstract**:
While Columnstore Indexes were introduced with SQL Server 2012, their popularity and general use haven't increased nearly as much as their functionality since then.  If you're someone that's not had much experience with Columnstore Indexes and want to learn more about them, this session is perfect for you as I plan to cover the Five Ws of Columnstore Indexes: what they are, when to use them, where they are best utilized, and most importantly why they work so well.  You'll be the "who" and after the session, I expect you'll feel more confident and excited to use this great feature.

Rick is a Microsoft Certified Master with more than 20 years of SQL Server experience in a variety of roles. He currently lives in Washington state and works as an independent consultant providing remote performance DBA and performance tuning services for clients in the USA and Canada. His first exposure to SQL Server was as a database developer, but over time he became more and more interested in how the database engine operated... eventually specializing more on performance issues than code.

Rick will work with all things relational, but most enjoys helping smaller companies get better performance from MSSQL, as well as smoothing over relationships between DBA and development teams.
