## Title: Big data architectures and the data lake
 
**Abstract**:
With so many new technologies it can get confusing on the best approach to building a big data architecture.  The data lake is a great new concept, usually built in Hadoop, but what exactly is it and how does it fit in?  In this presentation I’ll discuss the four most common patterns in big data production implementations, the top-down vs bottoms-up approach to analytics, and how you can use a data lake and a RDBMS data warehouse together.  We will go into detail on the characteristics of a data lake and its benefits, and how you still need to perform the same data governance tasks in a data lake as you do in a data warehouse.  Come to this presentation to make sure your data lake does not turn into a data swamp!

## Title: Reducing The Surface Area Of Risk in Data Security
 
**Abstract**:
Data obfuscation, also known as data masking, is soon a new legal requirement. Masking is the solution for non-production systems (i.e. DEV, TEST, etc) to greatly reduce the surface area of risk for data breach in your organization.  Masking should not be confused with encryption, which is an appropriate solution for production applications.  Those who believe that encryption solves all security problems are misled.

When done properly, masked data is not noticeable unless you look closely. Masking data well might still be usable for analytic reporting and aggregation, yet utterly useless for revealing confidential data. Masking is important enough that sophisticated software packages have become available.

Come learn about the right way to mask non-production data in order to allow the organization to limit possible exposure only to production.  Learn what techniques can be used, why, and what factors should be considered when deciding to secure confidential data.

## Title: I lost my job!  Now what?!?  A survival guide for the unemployed
 
**Abstract**:
You've just been told by HR that you are no longer a part of their organization.  You've been kicked to the curb.  You are now living in the no-man's land called unemployment.

Unemployment is a scary situation.  You're dealing with emotions and uncertainty.  You don't know if you'll be out of work for days, weeks, or months.

Fortunately, unemployment is survivable.  In this session, I'll share my own experiences (and perhaps we'll talk about some of yours) with unemployment, and how I managed to get through the tough times.  We'll discuss emotional impact, the job hunt, and things you can do to get yourself through this tough time.  Hopefully, you'll land on your feet once again before long!

## Title: Choosing technologies for a big data solution in the cloud
 
**Abstract**:
Has your company been building data warehouses for years using SQL Server?  And are you now tasked with creating or moving your data warehouse to the cloud and modernizing it to support “Big Data”?  What technologies and tools should use?  That is what this presentation will help you answer.  First we will level-set what big data is and other definitions, cover questions to ask to help decide which technologies to use, go over the new technologies to choose from, and then compare the pros and cons of the technologies.  Finally we will show you common big data architecture solutions and help you to answer questions such as: Where do I store the data?  Should I use a data lake?  Do I still need a cube?  Do I need the power of MPP?  Should I build a "logical data warehouse"?  And we'll close with showing some architectures of real-world customer big data solutions.  Come to this session to get started down the path to making the proper technology choices in moving to the cloud.

## Title: Controlling Competing Workloads with SQL Server Resource Governor
 
**Abstract**:
With heavily consolidated instances and competing workloads, the Enterprise only Resource Governor feature is an incredibly useful tool for any DBA to have in their toolbox. It allows for the effective throttling and control of CPU, memory and I/O consumed by multiple workloads running on a single SQL Server instance. In this session, we will cover the fundamental concepts of the SQL Server Resource Governor and provide demonstrations of practical scenarios where Resource Governor can control resources for specific workloads. Some of these demonstrations include how to limit the amount of memory consumed by memory-optimized tables and how to prevent poorly-written queries from overwhelming your storage subsystem. We will also discuss cases where Resource Governor can mitigate parameter sniffing problems. Finally, we will look at ways to leverage the useful information contained in the Resource Governor DMVs for monitoring and reporting.

## Title: Collecting Performance Metrics
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever had a manager standing over your shoulder, wanting to know why a server is running slowly? Or whether or not a server can handle additional workload? What information would you use to answer these questions? How would you share this information with your manager? The answer is baseline metrics.

Only if you have baseline performance information can you answer these questions and form a plan to address the issues at hand. In this session, we will be discussing several open source tools you can combine into an inexpensive baselining system you can use to troubleshoot issues and answer important questions.

Attendees in this session will learn how to collect important metric data, what data to collect, and how to interpret that data and develop a plan of action to address any issues.

## Title: Power BI Implementation: A Guide to the Other 90%
 
**Abstract**:
When learning about Power BI, the part you learn first is all the powerful visuals. But like an iceberg, that's just the 10% everyone sees. If you are asking yourself "what's next?", this training will teach your the other 90%.

In the first half of the day, we will focus on data manipulation. Often times, the hardest part of making a report is shaping the data. We will cover applied database theory, data cleansing with PowerQuery and data modelling with DAX. We'll show you what each tool is good at and when to use it. We'll also cover some internals so you understand at a deeper level how these tools really work.

The second half of the day is all about deployment and administration. Do you have a data governance plan in place? We'll show how to access your on-premises data with data gateways. We'll cover options for securing and protecting your data, including row-level security and auditing. Finally, we'll go over the ways you can share and distribute these reports.

## Title: Effective Data Warehouse Storage Patterns
 
**Abstract**:
Abstract:

Many companies start off with a simple data mart for reporting. As the company grows, users become dependent on the data mart for monitoring and making decisions on Key Performance Indicators (KPI).

Unexpected information growth in your data mart may lead to a performance impacted reporting system. In short, your users will be lining up at your cube for their daily reports.

How do you reduce the size of your data mart and speed up data retrieval?

This presentation will review the following techniques to fix your woes.

Coverage:

1 – What is horizontal partitioning?
2 – Database sharding for daily information.
3 – Working with files and file groups.
3 – Partitioned views for performance.
4 – Table and Index partitions.
5 – Row Data Compression.
6 – Page Data Compression.
7 – Programming a sliding window.
8 – What is different in Azure SQL database?

## Title: 5 Minute No Sweat SQL Security Audits
 
**Abstract**:
Security audits such as PCI, STIG, or HIPAA, are important and can be complicated. Depending on the requirements it may take considerable time to gather the information you will need.
In this session, you will get scripts that I use for compliance audits that help to collect the information required for many different audits quickly. Even when you have multiple SQL Servers, you can quickly and easily identify where to focus your efforts to ensure you pass security audits. Through demonstration and discussion of what and why certain items get reviewed you will leave with a better understanding of how to be compliant within you SQL Server environment.

## Title: New features in Management Studio and Showplan -- Performance Troubleshooting made easier!
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is now updated each month with the latest version of the SQL Client Tools.  Which enabled rapid enhancement to Execution Plan.  

Do you know that you can now see how many pages are spilled to disk for a sort, as well as the memory statistics for the operator? Are you aware that you can see the top 10 waits for an execution and what trace flags were active during compilation and which ones influenced compilation? Have you ever analyzed a big plan and wish you could search for table name, index name or column name without opening XML plan? When you see a clustered index was used do you know for sure which statistics were used by the Query Optimizer to estimate the number of rows? 

In this demo intensive session, I will show you how to find and use new features introduced into SSMS and Showplan.  You will walk out of this session equipped to make Query Performance Troubleshooting easier and ready to tackle those nasty, hard to solve query plans.

## Title: Statistics and Cardinality – How they work together
 
**Abstract**:
Are your statistics up to date? 
Yes, it’s that dreaded phrase you hear all the time when it comes to performance tuning your SQL Server. What does it matter? Why should I care about statistics? Aren’t they automatic or something like that?
In this session we will go over why statistics matter, how they are generated, how they impact performance, and even how to maintain them. Once we have that all settled, we will take a quick look at how the cardinality estimator uses statistics to determine a ‘good enough’ plan to use. We will close out the session by taking a look at the performance impact a simple upgrade of your SQL Server to 2014 and the new cardinality estimator can have.

## Title: Writing Advanced Functions in PowerShell
 
**Abstract**:
A lot of DBAs use Powershell to help automate complex tasks or apply configuration changes to multiple servers. Many are writing their own functions, and some may even have packaged them up into a custom module. What about more advanced features? How many are using verbose output, pipeline parameters, or parameter validation? These are just some of the features of something called "Advanced Functions" in PowerShell. In this session, we will discuss these topics and more as we work through all the components of a sample Advanced PowerShell function.

This session will be geared towards DBAs but will be useful for anyone wanting to learn more about PowerShell. Experience writing basic PowerShell functions is not a requirement, but will definitely make it easier to follow along. I highly recommend bringing a laptop with PowerShell 5.1 installed so attendees can follow along.

## Title: Extending DevOps to SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Most organizations are under pressure to speed up the software delivery cycle, whether that’s to respond more quickly to the needs of the business, the needs of your customers or just to keep up with the competition. Unfortunately, the database is commonly considered a bottleneck. Without the right processes in place, database change management can slow things down, adding risk, uncertainty, and getting in the way of development and operations working together to deliver. Any organization that wants to fully benefit from a DevOps approach is going to have to overcome some specific challenges presented by the database. This session will teach you how to take DevOps principles and practices and apply them to SQL Server so that you can speed up the database delivery cycle at the same time you protect the information contained within.

## Title: Entrepreneurship - Are you ready to make it on your own?
 
**Abstract**:
There's no doubt about it, being an entrepreneur can be very rewarding. However, it is far from easy. So, before you embark on that journey, you have to ask yourself if this is the right thing for you to do. But, how do you know?

Attend this inspiring session by Prof Joe Wehr of the MCCC and discover the good and the bad of becoming an entrepreneur. 

This includes the things everyone needs to know, like
- how to strategize and create a business plan
- how to secure financing
- what to look out for before hiring (hiring mistakes are very costly)

And the less obvious, including
- knowing when and how to get out (retirement, anybody?)
- the not so subtle difference between a consultant and an entrepreneur (this is an eye-opener)
- how to legally extend the reach of your cash (ever heard of multitasking your money?)

If you have been thinking about “it” but aren't sure if you're ready, you need to attend this session. You might be surprised what you learn about yourself.

## Title: XML and JSON deep dive
 
**Abstract**:
In the modern world of information technology, keeping data stored and manipulated reliably
and efficiently is one of the top priorities. Within the last decade, SQL Server has evolved into a
sophisticated Enterprise RDBMS tool, and it is still growing by providing more functionalities to store
and manipulate data reliably. eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is one of the technologies that SQL
Server implements not only for data manipulation but also for internal usage, such as Execution Plans,
Extended Events, DDL trigger Eventdata() function, and behind-the- scenes construction for SQL Server
Business Intelligence Tools (SSIS, SSRS, SSAS). XML skills often appear in SQL Server DBA job
requirements because the ability to work with XML allow the DBA to be faster and more efficient when
solving different types of problems.

## Title: Self Service Business Intelligence: Model for High Efficiency
 
**Abstract**:
The goal of business intelligence is to get the right information to the right people at the right time. Historically, the long-standing model for this process was completely IT owned. Business users had issues with the speed of delivery with this approach, along with the lack of flexibility. The self-service business intelligence model is a methodology that addresses these problems, and gives the end users more freedom with their data.

In this discussion, Zack Fanelle will be covering the intricacies of why the self-service business model drives high levels of efficiency and productivity. This requires a new approach to collaboration with the business and IT. In addition, he will be covering technical examples of what the model would look like in 2018 and how to take advantage of it using modern products.

## Title: REST Easy - Instant APIs for Your Database
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server provides database technology built with industry-leading performance, top-notch security and compliance, mission-critical availability, and a consistent experience across platforms and devices.

 API-driven data consumption platforms and services highlight the need for RESTful access to SQL server data. The existing options for REST access to SQL Server data or using web development frameworks to convert relational data to JSON objects soak up time, resources, and energy on software development and maintenance that enterprises could be using to drive business.

With the CData API Server, users can rapidly create RESTful APIs for SQL Server data using a point-and-click interface. API Server includes everything needed to create, run, manage, and secure APIs for your SQL Server data. In this talk, we will walk through creating an OData API for SQL Server data and demonstrate connectivity using modern web development frameworks.

## Title: So you want to Present: Tips and Tricks of the trade
 
**Abstract**:
So you've decided to take the leap into presenting. Maybe it's at your local user group, maybe it's at SQLSaturday.
This talk will guide you through the process of selecting a topic, preparing for it and actually giving it.

We'll talk about what can go wrong and how to handle that.
We'll also talk about what can be done to prevent something from going wrong in the first place.

What are some good guidelines to follow and when can, or even should, you break them.

This will be partly interactive so come with questions and be prepared to be asked some.

## Title: Mom Rules for Managing Enterprise Database Environments
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever looked at an environment and wondered how the heck they ever got anything done because it is so disorganized? The first thing I do for newly inherited environments is implement some organization and do some database clean up.  Not only does organization make the environment easier to maintain, it can help speed up trouble shooting.  Good organization can even help with some performance issues.

## Title: Tips on Managing Lots of SQL Servers
 
**Abstract**:
When managing a single server it is easy to keep track of the configuration of that server, but what about when you have more than ten servers to manage or a hundred? How do you know they are setup correctly?  How do you maintain the databases on each server? How do you take care of patching? How do you know when your server is on fire? 

In this talk we will answer these questions and more as we discuss technologies and approaches you can use to make sure your environment is configured and performing at its best.

My personal road to mastery of SQL began in the late nineties. At the time, opportunities to learn SQL in a formal, institutional setting were quite scarce, as the phenomenon of big data had not come to maturity. In lieu of any real scholastic alternative, I matriculated into the school of hard knocks—I learned SQL by trial and error, mostly error. It took 18 years, a few degrees, and more than a few lucky breaks before I succeeded in acquiring an authoritative, professional-level command over the language and applications of SQL. 

Here is the good news: it does not have to be as difficult for you as it was for me.
