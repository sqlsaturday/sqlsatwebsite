## Title: Self-Service Business Intelligence-MS PowerPivot
 
**Abstract**:
Ever wonder why there’s no “light” version of SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS)?  Find yourself wishing that SSAS offered an in-memory operation model akin to some of its competitors?  And why are OLAP cubes nearly impossible for end-users to build while comparable capabilities have existed for relational databases for at least 15 years?  Enter Microsoft’s product code-named “Gemini,” a component of the upcoming SQL Server 2008 R2 release, that joins together SSAS, Excel and SharePoint to make end-user analytics feasible, fun, publishable and discoverable by IT.  Andrew Brust will show you how it all works in this not-to-miss session.

## Title: More Unecessary Query Tuning
 
**Abstract**:
Pronounced muck, this session walks you through common but recurring coding problems, how to identify them, and how to solve them. Based on the book, SQL Server 2008 Query Performance Tuning Distilled, this session covers the information that query developers—which includes DBAs, application developers, report writers, and other data management professionals—need to know about in order to prevent recurring problems caused by poorly written or poorly configured code. Topics include things as simple as getting the data types correct, including the schema in defining objects, and avoiding operators in search conditions. More advanced topics are also discussed.

Using Response Time Analysis and Wait Types is a newer method for tuning SQL Server instances. As a result, there is often confusion on exactly what the data means.

This presentation will focus on these problems and review several real-life case studies of using SQL Server Wait Type data coupled with Response Time based performance analysis to solve the most difficult performance related issues.  Designed for the SQL Server DBA, Developer or anyone concerned with performance.

## Title: A step back in time - Temporal Database Designs
 
**Abstract**:
Jane Smith's name has a typo and someone fixes it. Jane gets married and she takes a new last name. It too has a typo, but gets corrected. A temporal database can show who changed what when. But wait there's more, querying the table "as-of" the day before Jane's wedding should return 'Smith' because that was the valid data on that effective date. Temporal databases have a reputation as being difficult, but I'll demo a few design patterns and timely functions that can tame the beast of time. Specifically you'll see: AutoAudit, temporal columns, temporal foreign keys and joins, and temporal hierarchies.
