## Title: The Battle of DBAAS – RDS vs Cloud SQL vs SQL Azure
 
**Abstract**:
The public cloud is making a huge impact on the way enterprises host, manage, and scale their database operations. They can provision new infrastructure at the click of a button, without a lengthy hardware procurement process. Through a range of Database as a Service (DBaaS) options, public cloud vendors now make it easier than ever for organizations to migrate and maintain their databases. But while these solutions address many of the headaches involved in database management such as migration, provisioning, and administration, there are significant differences between the various DBaaS offerings on the market. In this session, we explore these DBaaS solutions provided by the leading cloud platforms, AWS, GCP, and Azure, and compare key features such as the types of the Database Engines on offer, Infrastructure Design Challenges, DR and HA capabilities, Performance Indicators, Pricing and Database Security.

## Title: My Power BI Report is Slow: What Should I Do?
 
**Abstract**:
You created a wonderful Power BI report, but when you open it you wait too much time. Changing a slicer selection is also slow. Where should you start analyzing the problem? What can you do to optimize performance?

This session will guide you in analyzing the possible reasons for a slow Power BI report. By using Task Manager and DAX Studio, you will be able to determine whether you should change the report layout, or if there is something in DAX formulas or in the data model that is responsible for the slow response.

At the end of this session, you will understand how to locate a performance bottleneck in a Power BI report, so you will focus your attention on the biggest issue.

## Title: What's Going On in My Power BI Environment?
 
**Abstract**:
As Power BI is a self-service tool, it can be hard for administrators to monitor it. Power BI is fast improving in this context but there still isn’t a consistent way of monitoring it. There are compliance, governance, performance, and implementation questions to consider. Who is creating content, how is it being distributed, what data is being used, dataset refreshes, who has a trial license, and what report is the most used? These are just some of the questions you as an administrator of Power BI might want to get answers to. 

In this session, we will look at how you can find those answers by monitoring Power BI. We will look at the Power BI Audit log for usage, license, and other audit information. We will look at what the Power BI API can show us about data sets, refresh history, Enterprise Gateway information, premium capacity, and artifact inventory. 

Lastly we will show how you can automate the data collection via Azure and PowerShell and report on the results.

## Title: Extracting information from your unstructured data with Azure Cognitive Search
 
**Abstract**:
AI enrichment is a capability of Azure Cognitive Search indexing that is used to extract latent information from images, blobs, and other unstructured, non-text data sources - enriching the content to make it more searchable in an index or knowledge store. 

Both extraction and enrichment tasks  are implemented through cognitive skills such as natural language processing and image processing skills with several possibilities: Entity recognition, language detection, sentiment detection, OCR, face detection...

In this session, the Azure Cognitive Search service will be explored and described. Then, an enrichment pipeline capable of extracting information from images and documents (PDF, Word) will be built in order to demonstrate a use case scenario, along with requirements, costs, related Azure services and a website/mobile app that allows users to look for information from the files.

## Title: A Walk Around SQL PowerShell
 
**Abstract**:
PowerShell has been out for a long time now, and it is certainly not new for the DBA with all the modules and code floating around, yet there are many that have decided not to adopt it. This session takes a casual walk around SQL and PowerShell together and shows how powerful it is and how easy it is to get started. But be warned, once you slip into the pool and get past the shock of the "colder than you like" water, you will be hooked. Don't take my word for it, join me for a session that takes you through a little SMO and last the SQLServer module and the provider it gives you access to. You will be glad you did.

## Title: Jupyter Notebooks for DBAs
 
**Abstract**:
Jupyter Notebooks were once the realm of Data Scientists. New releases of Azure Data Studio, Visual Studio Code, and .NET interactive tooling have brought this tooling into the Operational team's area. The biggest benefit of using Jupyter Notebooks is that you have your documentation, your code __and__ your results in the same source controllable document.

I will share with you all of the knowledge I have gained over the past 12 months implementing Jupyter Notebooks for Data Operation teams.

You will leave  
- with a good understanding of possible use cases for Jupyter Notebooks
- being comfortable in using the different tooling
- with many examples that you can take back to work and start being effective immediately

Enabling collaboration with your team, simplifying common tasks, improving Incident Wash-Up meetings, creating run-books, easily creating code for others to use are some of the benefits that you will take away. 
We will have fun as well.

## Title: Database Reliability Engineer - the new DBA?
 
**Abstract**:
Database technology has been evolving for years now - rather than being just SQL Server we now talk about managing a data platform.

The skillset of the DBA needs to rapidly change/evolve and they need to be generalists who are familiar with different platforms and the ability to recommend the right fit for an application. Whilst still being specialised enough to support a database to meet business application requirements.

Database Reliability Engineering teams configure, manage and support database infrastructure, writing the automation that builds databases to scale to serve hundreds of thousands of queries per second.

They embrace automation, they understand and leverage cloud services and using DevOps is how they approach all aspects of database installation, configuration and management.

This session will introduce the Database Reliability Engineer which is the new DBA.

## Title: Scaling databases to Enterprise scale - Vertical vs Horizontal
 
**Abstract**:
Think back a year.  Your current databases happily serve 10k customers.
Now you've got 100k.  There are performance issues, but nothing you can't handle with some DBCC FREEPROCCACHE calls when a "bad" plan is created or some ad-hoc creation of new covering indexes as the dev teams release features...
Oh crap.  Executives have just announced we're targeting 1M customers in 18 months.

This session talks about how to scale your data platform.
It's not just a case of throwing more CPU and memory at the problem.  We'll talk about how you can scale horizontally (sharding) as well as working with product teams to revisit their calls...

## Title: Exploring Window Functions
 
**Abstract**:
Window Functions first emerged with the 2005 release – and were enhanced in 2012.
They provide a window over the result set and the ability to access data other than the current row.
This means that somethings that may  - at first - seem like they need row-by-row processing can be done in one single set-based query.
The set of window functions available also includes server analytical functions that give the ability to perform statistical analysis.
Come along to this session and see a deep dive into window functions and learn how their use will add to your ability to process data and write more efficient – and cleaner – queries.

## Title: 5 Availability Groups Issues That May Ruin Your Day
 
**Abstract**:
AlwaysOn Availability Groups have become the most common High Availability technology used with SQL Server. It provides protection at the database group level, and it stores a separate copy of each database on each node, eliminating storage from being a single point of failure.

While Availability Groups help to achieve required High Availability, they may also introduce issues in the system. In this session, Dmitri will discuss several less-known problems associated with them. You will learn how Availability Groups may impact transaction log truncation and contribute to the blocking in the system, how readable secondaries may increase CPU and I/O load on primaries among a few other things. Dmitri will also discuss how to properly setup monitoring for Availability Group infrastructure in your environment.

## Title: Introduction to Numeric Calculations in DAX
 
**Abstract**:
DAX (Dynamic Analysis Expressions) is a formula language to enrich imported data with calculated columns, calculated tables and measures. While the syntax of the language is derived from Excel’s formula language and easy to learn, some of the functions are hiding a real complex semantic. In this talk we will concentrate on numeric calculated columns and measures. You will learn about the differences and advantages of each. You will leave this talk with the knowledge, how to distinguish filter contexts and row contexts and in which cases to use calculated columns and in which cases to use measures.

## Title: Calculation Group in SSAS 2019
 
**Abstract**:
Calculation group is a new DAX feature introduced in SSAS 2019 where it creates generic DAX formulas in the model and  uses them for different measures in the reports. For example time series calculations such as MTD(month to date), YTD(year to date), same period in previous year are very popular and are usually required to be created for most of the measures. By creating these measures  for any numeric metrics( such as sales, orders, refund,…) we will end up with too many measures which take a lot of development time and make the model pilled up with many measures. Instead of creating measures for each metric, the formula can be created once in a Calculation Group and then be used in the reports for multiple measures.

## Title: The Lowdown on Character Data Types in SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Character data types should be simple. But they're not. In this session Greg will show you how they really work, and challenge a number of common myths. As an example, if you think that varchar(20) means a string of up to 20 characters long, you should attend. If you don't get why there's an N in front of many string values, you should attend. And if you aren't really clear on Unicode, UTF-8, and supplementary characters, you should also attend.
