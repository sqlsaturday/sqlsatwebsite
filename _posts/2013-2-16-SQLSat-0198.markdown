## Title: Large SQL Workloads on Microsoft's Private Cloud
 
**Abstract**:
In this session you will learn about the capabilities in Windows Server 2012 Hyper-V that allow you to take large-scale SQL Server workloads and migrate them to Microsoft’s Private Cloud.  You will find out how to configure the key resources – memory, CPU, network, and disk – to help enable the largest SQL Server implementations to perform well.  You will see how System Center 2012 SP1 helps you deal with performance and other issues allowing you to respond more quickly to elements that may impact the applications your users depend on.  Finally, we will demonstrate how implementing SQL Server on a Private Cloud helps to more easily deal with routine maintenance of both SQL Server and the infrastructure supporting it.

## Title: UDFs, or: How to kill performance in one easy step
 
**Abstract**:
User-defined functions in SQL Server are very much like custom methods and properties in .Net languages. At first sight, they seem to be the perfect tool to introduce code encapsulation and reuse in T-SQL. So why is this feature mostly avoided by all T-SQL gurus?
The reason is performance. In this session, you will learn how user-defined functions feed the optimizer with misleading and insufficient information, how the optimizer fails to use even what little information it has, and how this can lead to shocking query performance.
However, you will also see that there is a way to avoid the problems. With just a little extra effort, you can reap the benefits of SQL Server and still get good performance.

## Title: Demystifying BISM and Tabular Mode SSAS
 
**Abstract**:
With the release of SQL 2012, Analysis Services (SSAS) has seen some major changes.  An entire new method of modelling analytic data has emerged and it's called Tabular Mode Analysis Services.  In addition to that, a new semantic layer has been added to the tool, the Business Intelligence Semantic Model (BISM), which will help to bring the two modes -- Multidimensional and Tabular -- into one level playing arena.

In this session, attendees will gain understanding of what Multidimensional and Tabular modelling IS, as well as how the BISM layer helps to translate user requests to ensure no confusion is made. Attendees will also learn how to BUILD a Tabular model, and will help design a solution live during the presentation.

## Title: The Essential 8: Narrative Reporting Techniques
 
**Abstract**:
Providing boring static reports is no longer acceptable in today's business culture.  Analytics are expected to be highly visual, interactive, and should tell a meaningful story.  The latest version of Microsoft Excel is designed to perform those duties and more.  Narrative reporting goes far beyond the tabular format and eliminates the need for comments.

Learn how to craft narrative style reporting in this unique session.  Join Josh Fennessy and Julie Koesmarno as they guide you through several design scenarios that are often asked of a business analyst.  You'll learn Excel reporting techniques that will enable you to build highly visual and interactive reports without the need for heavy infrastructure requirements.

## Title: Introducing SQL Server Data Tools! (Project Juneau
 
**Abstract**:
Data Dude gone wild!!! Your final scripts deployed to the live database a few months ago and almost everything went perfectly. Since then you have heard there were few index patches needed maybe even a new column in one or the tables. The live database has drifted just a little from your deployed SQL scripts. How would you like to update your next baseline code to already resemble the current state of the production database? This is just one of the incredible features you can do with SSDT. Take the statefull nature of your database to create and test your code automatically and declaratively. Database developers can use the SQL Server Object Explorer in VS to easily. See how the new scripting and automation tools are used in SQL 2012.

Profiling data allows you to understand various aspects of new you receive. By profiling data you can make sure it meets your data quality standards. During this session we will be exploring the SSIS Data Profiling task to quickly analyze your data. Each of the eight different profiles available will be reviewed. A number of demos will be shown so you understand how to use and configure the different profiles. You will learn how to use the Data Profiling task output to control your SSIS data flow. Additionally you will be shown how to store the profiling output in SQL Server, so you can produce trend reports based on past profiling output information.

## Title: Taking BI to the Next Level: Collaboration
 
**Abstract**:
Self-service BI is usually an independent activity. But when individuals discover interesting information that they want to share, they need a centralized location to do that. When people work together, new insights are possible, and that’s what collaboration is all about. As more people see the benefits of the solution, they become more likely to use it. As individual products, SQL Server 2008 R2, SharePoint 2010, and Excel 2010 expand your options for enabling BI in your organization, but collectively they create a solid platform for collaborative BI. Knowing which tool to use for which job can be tricky. Come to this session to learn how to use these tools to foster collaboration.

OFFSET / FETCH will be covered to show you how to eliminate cursors or CTEs for data paging.  With CONCAT you have an easier time building strings in your TSQL statements independent of the data type, and without concern over nulls.

## Title: Inheriting a database for Developers, version 2
 
**Abstract**:
There are very few applications which are being developed from zero, the most are apps are simply inherited from previous development teams. This session serves to show some easy implementable practices to follow after inheriting a database. Those practices allow to check some if the database design was done in regards to the actual data, or if while implementing some of the constraints and checks some tables were left behind. :) The practices shown in this session will allow to check the database design and identify some of the possible performance degradations.

## Title: New SQL 2012 Functions
 
**Abstract**:
Using a Function is quick and easy if you know they are there. Functions always do or return something useful. When you send data into a function, it does its work and then sends you back some information.  Each version of SQL server adds new functionality and 2012 continues that tradition. Many things you may not even have to build since more system supplied functions now ship with SQL Server 2012. This session will focus on the new string, time and logical functions added to SQL Server 2012.
