## Title: Codecraft
 
**Abstract**:
Winning a round of golf doesn't make you Tiger Woods. Knowing how to ride a bike doesn't make you Lance Armstrong and collecting a salary to do something doesn't mean you are proficient at it. Being able to write software that doesn't break and getting paid for it doesn't make you a professional.
Software development is a craft and, like every other craft, to be a master craftsman you must be one who practices it with great skill. Learn the tools of the craft, the discipline to use them and start your journey to becoming a master craftsman.
