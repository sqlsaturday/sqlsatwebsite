## Title: Eyes on the Prize:  Simple and Effective Dashboard Visualization Techniques
 
**Abstract**:
When done right, data visualization informs users quickly and efficiently with a minimum of distraction.  When done wrong, we end up with spinning 3D pie charts.  In this talk, we will look at techniques for effective dashboard design, minimizing noise and clutter (like spinning 3D pie charts) while providing relevant information to the intended audience.  We will see how different types of charts work, build out rules of thumb around which charts to use, and integrate visuals to create a coherent dashboard image.  When it comes to dashboards, we will compare and contrast dashboards based on their intended uses, such as interactive dashboards versus TV dashboards.  Finally, we will take an awful dashboard and turn it into something which end users will appreciate.

## Title: Getting started with SQL Azure Database: What you need to know
 
**Abstract**:
Azure SQL Database offers a way to quickly spin up new databases with minimal management requirements. However, the number of differences between on-premises SQL Server and Azure SQL Database can be overwhelming. Even worse, with DBaaS it’s not clear who is responsible for what anymore.
In this session, we will cover all the basic steps of getting your first Azure SQL Database instance spun up. We’ll cover common gotchas, like firewall settings and resource locks. We’ll also dive into some more advanced options with templates, allowing you to make your processes reproducible.
By the end of this presentation, you’ll understand if Azure SQL Database is the right choice for you and your needs. You’ll understand how it can simplify management and allow you to scale easily. Finally, you’ll have the confidence to go and create your own instance with ease.

## Title: Quick and Dirty Push Datasets with Power BI
 
**Abstract**:
Using Power BI, you can connect to hundreds of different data sources.  Once you have published your data to the Power BI service, you can use an on-premises gateway to refresh your datasets up to every 15 minutes.  Power BI can also connect live to large cubes that are a result of very complex ETL and calculations.  Some of these cubes may only be refreshed daily or weekly.  For real-time streaming of data, you can use Azure Stream Analytics or the Power BI REST API.  

Have you heard of Power BI push datasets?  With push datasets, data is pushed into the Power BI service.  Since it is stored there, you can use all of Power BI's report building features with it.

In this session, I walk through the different options for real-time streaming in Power BI.  I will demonstrate setting up a push dataset and show you a very easy way to push data to Power BI using PowerShell.  I will also demonstrate a Power BI push dataset connected to a Microsoft Cognitive Services Computer Vision app.

## Title: Data Science, and the changing Role of Data professionals; Data-Information-Knowledge and Wisdom
 
**Abstract**:
Data Science techniques are becoming popular and because statistics usually teaches at the Math Department people think of it as an exact science but Statistic is the science of prediction and expectations. In the excitement of the possibilities that Big Data technology and Data Science techniques are opening, we are forgetting that correlation is not equal than causation and that any design model has intrinsic limitations. 
Dr. Deming said "In God we trust, all others must bring data." but what he really wanted to reach was Wisdom! Data is just the raw material the real goal is Wisdom I have been thinking about the chain toward Wisdom (Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom) and wonder how many organizations have reached, at least, the level of Knowledge and if any at all have reached the pinnacle of Wisdom. 
We are drowning in a sea of data and we are starving for wisdom.
How is Data Science and Big Data changing our profession? What is a Data Scientist? Which skills do we need?

## Title: Cautionary Tale of Recompilations, Excessive CPU Load and Plan Caching
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server reduces compilation and optimization overhead by caching and reusing execution plans for the queries. Plan caching helps to reduce CPU load on the server; however, it may also introduce unexpected issues and lead to suboptimal execution plans and performance problems.  

In this session, Dmitri will explain how plan caching works internally and demonstrate how to address several common issues related to the plan caching. He will talk about parameter sniffing, simple and forced parameterization, OPTIMIZE FOR UNKNOWN strategy, and several other related topics.    Finally, Dmitri will provide the guidelines how to reduce CPU load and recompilation overhead in the systems with heavy ad-hoc workload and non-parameterized queries.
