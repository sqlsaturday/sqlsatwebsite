## Title: The Irish Economic Crisis Visualised with Power BI
 
**Abstract**:
In this session we will explore the Irish Economic Crisis from multiple perspectives, using Microsoft’s latest Visualisation tools including Power BI, Power Query, Power Map, Power View and SharePoint”.   It starts from a very common business angle, where people need to make sense of data, fast, but don't know what questions to ask, nor how to combine available sources in a way that makes sense.   This session converts the Irish Economic crisis into a story that can be explored in an interactive way, using familiar tools, in a way that people may feel should have been noticed in the run-up to the crisis. Come by to find out what led to a small country owing over 200 billion euro and if Power BI could have helped.   Come and find out where all the money came from and what Ireland spent it on!

## Title: First steps in continuous integration for databases with Red Gate’s SQL Automation Pack.
 
**Abstract**:
At previous SQLSaturday Dublin events, you’ve seen how easy it is to get your SQL Server databases in source control.
In this session, we’ll build on this foundation and look at the resources you can use to set up an automated build process for your databases.
Starting with a database that’s source controlled using Red Gate’s SQL Source Control, we’ll use the SQL Automation Pack and Team City to set up a simple build process that runs every time you commit a change.
You’ll see how this process helps you spot and fix errors quicker, and how you can use it to produce an artefact you can use for reliable, repeatable deployments in the future.
One lucky session attendee will also win a license of the SQL Automation Pack during this session, so don’t miss out!

## Title: Learning Entity Framework 6
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft has clearly positioned the Entity Framework 6 (EF) as the primary data access platform for .NET applications. But many developers have yet to embrace the powerful Object Relational Mapping (ORM) capabilities that EF offers. Whether you’re new to ORM, or you’ve dabbled in other ORM technologies, Lenni will show how quickly you can start working with EF6 and boost your productivity when building data-centric .NET applications.

We’ll begin with a quick introduction to ORM and EF, and then explain many of the special ORM features in EF6, such as the Entity Data Model, and table splitting, inheritance, entity splitting, and many-to-many relationships. With the basics covered, Lenni will then dive right into live demos that show what EF can do for you as a data access layer, using database-first, model-first, and code-first approaches with both direct SQL and stored procedures. We’ll also discuss new features introduced in EF6, and show how to use EF in N-Tier scenarios.

## Title: SQOOP - Taking relational data to Hadoop and back again
 
**Abstract**:
SQOOP or SQL to Hadoop is a tool in the Hadoop ecosystem that lets you take your "SQL" data and put it into Hadoop or vice versa.  The use cases are numerous.  You can have Hadoop perform the heavy lifting using Map Reduce and then use SQOOP to take the results and put them in "SQL".  You can have Hadoop act as your Data Warehouse and use SQOOP to do your daily loads from your relational DB into Hadoop.
SQOOP is a command line tool but don't let that put you off.  
This session will look at SQOOP and the plethora of options available to you on the command line.  If you want to learn about SQOOP then this is the session for you.

## Title: A One Hour Data Analysts Toolkit: using R and PowerBI
 
**Abstract**:
If you want to conduct advanced Business Intelligence development and Business Analysis, then it is useful to understand data visualisation and have R as a tool in your toolset. In this intensive one hour session, we will look at the latest suite of Microsoft Business Intelligence tools - Microsoft Power BI in conjunction with R. The demos will be implemented in both tools in an end-to-end hour long session so that delegates can see when to use each technology in order to determine 'what to use' and 'when to use it', as well as seeing where the technologies complement each other. We will visualise the data according to data visualisation principles set out by Stephen Few amongst others.

## Title: Replication Troubleshooting  Monitoring
 
**Abstract**:
Replication is a powerful feature that has long been available in SQL Server.  However, with great power come great headaches! Replication normally runs happily once set up, but if things go wrong it can turn into a seemingly never ending list of errors.  In this session I will dig into how replication can go wrong (and has gone wrong for me) and what steps you can take to fix these issues.  Along the way I will go into what monitoring options you have when working with replication and also a couple of gotchas that have caught me out in the past.

## Title: SQL anti patterns
 
**Abstract**:
You can learn SQL in three days but it'll take you 10 years to become good at it. In this session we will have a look at some basic design errors and get a notion of the things that absolutely doesn't work. Antipatterns is a way of naming common design errors in order to make them easier to remember - even if you haven't done them yet.

We will become acquainted with antipatterns on a physical level, a logical level and an sql-queries and application level, and spice it up with some seriously foolish errors made by me and my colleagues. The session is relevant for developers and DBAs.

## Title: How to write professional Powershell scripts
 
**Abstract**:
You probably have a few Powershell scripts sitting around, perhaps written from scratch but most likely you borrowed the idea from a blog somewhere, and then used those as templates to achieve your goal. It's time to take those ad-hoc scripts turn them into your very own module. And while we're at it we might as well add proper error handling, parameterization and pipeline support. I will also demonstrate how to build help, force and whatif support.
This is a demo rich session and all demos will be covering practical SQL Server related solutions.

## Title: Using Power BI and SharePoint as a rapid development BI Strategy
 
**Abstract**:
See how you can use Excel and SharePoint to quickly implement a BI solution with Power BI. The Power BI tools allow you to extract, transform and load your data (Power Query), model that data (Power Pivot) and visualise the resulting analyses (Power View and Power Map) all within Excel. The results can be shared simply in the cloud with Office365 SharePoint Online. If you’re ready for the next level you can migrate your model to SQL Server Analysis Services on-premise or stick with the cloud using Azure Virtual Machines.
