## Title: SS2014/2016 In-Memory Tables:  Formula 1 Performance Unleashed!
 
**Abstract**:
Query performance is what it is all about.  SQL Server 2014 gave us the new in-memory functionality that takes a completely different approach to data access and manipulation.  Google “In-Memory Tables” and you’ll get a myriad of results from white papers, blogs, webinars, etc.  This session will consolidate the relevant information from all these sources so the production DBA/Developer will be able to understand, create, use, maintain, and trouble-shoot in-memory table functionality.  This session will also examine several demo scripts showing performance gains using the in-memory tables over equivalent disk based tables.  
This session is all about when and how to apply in-memory tables in a production environment.
After this session you will
1.	 Understand what in-memory tables are and how to create and maintain them including their limitations
2.	Be able to identify performance gains over equivalent disk back tables
3.	Comprehend the new data monitoring needed for in-memory table

## Title: A SQL Developer’s Guide to MDX Basics
 
**Abstract**:
You already know how to write SQL queries against a data warehouse but your new job responsibilities require you to write MDX queries against Analysis Services (SSAS). MDX is the query language of SSAS in multidimensional mode. While SQL and MDX share some common keywords, they have very different syntax and concepts. In fact, the common keywords can be confusing if you are used to thinking in SQL. 
 
In this session you will explore how data is organized in SSAS in a data structure called a cube. Next, we will write MDX queries while comparing them with SQL queries that return similar results. You will see how certain queries are much easier to write in MDX, especially when it comes to querying data that contains hierarchies such as a date rollup. Finally, you will learn how to capture MDX queries generated by Excel and SQL Server Management Studio, to use as practical examples of how to write MDX queries.

## Title: Inside the Query Optimizer
 
**Abstract**:
When it comes to SQL Server one of the biggest request you hear is “How can I make my Query Run FASTER!?”.  The answer understanding the first step in that process Is understanding the Query Optimizer.  Understanding the Optimizer beings with knowing the Rules.  The way our queries are written reflect directly on the output that we get. In this session we will look at the rules in SQL Server, write queries to show those rules in action, and walk out with a better understanding of how the Optimizer works.

## Title: Building Defense in Depth Using the Full Spectrum of SQL Server Encryption
 
**Abstract**:
As the threat of Cybercrime and data breaches increases, it is important to know and understand the variety of options available to protect Personally Identifying Information and other business sensitive data. You need to be prepared to defend yourself from the threat of data theft by learning about and combining methods of encrypting data at rest and in transit. In this presentation, you will learn about encrypting data at rest, data in transit, securing the channels through which data is transported and other topics related to cryptography in SQL Server including details about validating certificates and preventing man in the middle attacks against your server. Other topics include an overview of replicating encrypted data and designing systems so that the DBA can't decrypt the data. By the end of the session, you will understand how and when to use and combine every available encryption feature to design a defense in depth strategy for protecting data from escaping your network.

## Title: From Non-Technical to Fully Employed Technical:  The Road Less Traveled.
 
**Abstract**:
My technical path started at a SQLSaturday event in Jacksonville in 2010.  Today I am Microsoft Certified and working full time as a Business Intelligence Report Developer.  Sometimes it’s hard to envision the finished product of your labors when you’re in the middle of the construction mess.  And it’s hard not to become frustrated when you can’t instantly learn all the great technical stuff out there.  Well, you’re heard that Rome wasn’t built in a day, and neither will your technical studies.  Building a solid technical foundation takes time and a ‘no quit’ attitude.  If there was another way to do it, I would have found it by now!  
Three foundation bricks for your technical base:
1.	How to learn/improve T-SQL on your own?  The Best and the Cheapest Way to Learn T-SQL
2.	The Importance of the Technical Community in the learning process
3.	Finding a Mentor and being a good mentee!

## Title: Automated Cancer Detection with Deep Learning
 
**Abstract**:
Deep Learning as a general approach to image processing tasks like detection, recognition and localization have enjoyed tremendous success in recent years. However, deep learning has not yet been applied to certain ripe areas of medical imaging - specifically detecting cancer in gigabit sized scanned slides (commonly referred to as whole slide images or WSIs). In this session Matt will describe the development of an end-to-end image processing system that NLP Logix developed to automate the process of detecting WSI that contain cancer cells. The session will walk through the process of designing the system, training a deep model using TensorFlow (expect a discussion on GPUs) and call out all challenges encountered along the way.

The system developed by NLP Logix received an IEEE award for image process as part of the 2016 Grand Challenges in Biomedical Image Analysis.

## Title: Breaking into the Azure-PowerBI World
 
**Abstract**:
How to get started in Azure-PowerBI from a DBA background.
You know SQL.  You probably have SQL installed on your own box; you’re familiar and comfortable with SSMS.  There’s all this talk of Azure.   There’s all this talk of PowerBI.  You're not sure how to start.  You're not sure where you even want to go.  You're not sure why you would use Azure...  You're not quite sure what tools you need, let alone how to tie them together.  That's why you want to come to this session.  I'll start you off with what you know...SSMS, and add tools and connections until you have filled Azure with data from SSMS and then tied Azure to PowerBI.  Along the way we'll highlight key parts of the techniques that tie all these pieces together.  At the end you'll see a PowerBI presentation sourced from Azure that you saw created from your favorite, comfortable tool...SSMS.
This set of knowledge can help you in your career planning, and if nothing else, should help you in creating a technical strategy!

## Title: Data Migration Using BIML
 
**Abstract**:
Many companies scale out their databases horizontally, partitioning data by customer (or some other identifier) into separate databases or instances.  Sometimes, it becomes important to move that data from one database to another.  SQL Server Integration Services is a fantastic tool for ETL, but creating and maintaining dozens or hundreds of data flows by hand is exhaustingly tedious.  Instead of doing it the hard way, use the BI Markup Language (BIML) to automate package development.  This talk will show how we can use metadata tables and BIML to auto-create SSIS packages to migrate data from one database to another, handling foreign key constraints along the way.

## Title: Indexing your Data Warehouse
 
**Abstract**:
One of the primary skill sets most database professionals are initially required to “master” is the art of proper indexing in our databases. We learn early on that an effective indexing configuration will go further in making our databases perform efficiently than probably any other single tuning technique. What’s not so commonly discussed though are the varying approaches one may wish to utilize when indexing your SQL Server enterprise data warehouse.  This session will hopefully cause you to take a good look at your current indexing to see if indeed it could be operating even more efficiently.
