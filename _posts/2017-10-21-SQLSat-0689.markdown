## Title: Scripting Tabular models
 
**Abstract**:
Introducing the new scripting language for tabular models. Before SQL Server 2016 tabular models was wrapped into a multidimensional constructs. TOM is the new native library for tabular - this makes it easy to maintain, modify and deploy your model.

During this session I will go through and explain some examples and best practices on generating a SSAS tabular model by using the new TOM. I will spend some time showing and explaining a real world example on pushinga measure creation and changes to the key business stakeholders and to ensure quick time to market.

The last thing i will show is how you speed up your development free up up to 50% of the time you spend building tabular models with the simple and advanced features of Tabular Editor 2.0

## Title: Enabling Citizen Data Science with Microsoft
 
**Abstract**:
In times past, Data Science was only for those elite few with a rare combination of skills including advanced knowledge of statistics.
Microsoft has been making sure that everyone can participate in the data revolution by giving people access to predictive API’s, in-database advanced analytics and drag-and-drop predictive experiments. All thanks to SQL Server 2016 and the Cortana Intelligence Suite in Azure.
These advances have given people with less knowledge of statistics and programming the ability to become what Gartner calls citizen data scientists. Should we be worried about creating fools-with-tools or should we embrace the democratization of data science as the golden age of data?
In this demo heavy session we explore Microsoft’s solutions to ensure democratization of data science and the possible dangers that lurk below the surface.

## Title: Data Science with SQL Server 2016 and R
 
**Abstract**:
One of the most notable additions to the Microsoft BI stack is the addition of Microsoft R Server inside SQL Server 2016. The inbuilt ScaleR packages deliver scalability and multithreading capabilities that open-source R can’t easily provide, opening up a world of possibilities for data scientists interested in machine learning and predictive analytics. But what does this look like on a Microsoft platform?

Oliver Frost, a Data Science Engineer at Direct Line Group, demonstrates what tools are available to you as a data scientist inside SQL Server 2016. Discover how R adds value where traditional relational databases struggle, how to use ScaleR functions to build predictive models and efficient machine learning pipelines.

## Title: From SQL to R – Leverage Your T-SQL Knowledge to Learn R
 
**Abstract**:
You are already familiar with T-SQL and are eager to learn R but do not know where to start? Start from what you already know: T-SQL. Both languages have many things in common on some levels, but are very different on others. You will learn how to begin your first steps in the new language and how to perform the most common tasks, typical for R: statistics, machine learning  data visualization.
This session will kick you off to the new language by using analogies from T-SQL. You will learn how to write your first R-scripts, make usage of packages and will leave this session with a basic understanding of typical use-cases of R and how to integrate that into your existing environment with SQL Server.

## Title: Scale-Out your SSIS Package Executions
 
**Abstract**:
With a rising number of parallel SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) package executions the resource requirements on the SSIS server can be a limiting factor. In older SQL Server versions, scale-out architectures needed to be implemented by hand and required a lot of manual implementation effort. Beginning with SQL Server 2017, SSIS provides a built-in scale-out functionality for package executions. 
After the definition of scalability-types, the SSIS scale-out architecture and the involved system-parts are introduced. The attendees will learn the basics, get checklists and best practices when building up their own SSIS scale-out cluster. In addition to the configuration using SSMS other configuration options (command line, T-SQL,..) are presented. Behind the scenes information like logging, the programmability interfaces and configuration options will be shared.

## Title: A Game of Hierarchies: Introduction to Graph Processing with SQL
 
**Abstract**:
Hierarchies are the bread and butter of most business applications and you find them almost everywhere:
* Product Categories
* Sales Territories
* Bill of Material
* Calendar and Time
Even when there is a big need from a business perspective, the solutions in relational databases are mostly sort of awkward. The most flexible hierarchies are usually modeled as self-referenced tables. If you want to successfully query such self-referenced hierarchies, you will need either loops or recursive Common Table Expressions. SQL Server 2017 comes now with a different approach: Graph Database. 
Join this session for a journey through best practices to transform your hierarchies into useful information. We will have fun playing around with a sample database based on G. R. R. Martin’s famous “Game of Thrones”.

## Title: Database corruption
 
**Abstract**:
In this session, you will learn how to detect and avoid common problems related to database corruption. There will be a description of the data structures in SQL Server and how it can affect the availability of SQL Server during corruption. On the session, there will be not only theoretical knowledge but many real life examples with demos.

## Title: Hello SQL! I'm Python! What can I do for you?
 
**Abstract**:
At last... After SQL Server 2016 brought us the R language integration the newest 2017 version brings Python in its toolbox. Python is well known as tool for machine learning, advanced analytics and doing a lot of amazing and crazy things. Like its R companion it also has a powerful libraries support for scaling and big data handling. So let's see what the famous scripting snake can do for us.
During the session you will learn how to set up the integration, run simple scripts, use Python for transforming the data, use the Matplotlib library to visualise data in reports, create and run machine learning models with predictions.

## Title: Real world DevOps - challenges, tools and solutions
 
**Abstract**:
So you want to use AlwaysEncrypted, but your app is not using driver level parameters? Or you want to parameterize ad-hoc queries, without rewriting your application? Or you just want to pretty print your t-sql code? SQLDOM is here to help. Not very popular but extremely useful utility/library that can help anyone to intercept and rewrite queries during runtime so they meet feature requirements or just fix performance.

## Title: Data Warehouse Testing and Why You Should Care!
 
**Abstract**:
How do you test your data warehouse? Do you even test? Let's face the truth that data processing solutions are very rarely tested ... 
So let's start with fundamentals of (not only data warehouse) testing, why you should have sleepless nights (today) and how to avoid them (in the future). Two Joyful Craftsmen: Jaroslav Reken  Tomas Tucek will bring a piece of theory, but mainly practical examples, from real life ... mainly to get you out of your comfort zone!

## Title: APPLY operator in action
 
**Abstract**:
APPLY operator is a T-SQL table operator that allows to boost query perfomance and to solve complex calculation problems in an very efficient way. 
But it isn't easy to understandt how does it work and how it can be applied to our queries. 
In this session, we will examine the various types of APPLY operator (CROSS APPLY, OUTER APPLY) to understand it's behaviour and the power it holds.
We will go through many real world cases to show how we can use the APPLY operator, when writing queries, instead of JOINs 
and we will show how performances can be improved by using this operator the right way.

I am currently working as a Data Engineer, improving the company data platform and providing the necessary resources for our data consultants. I am extremely fortunate to dabble with a number of tools including those from the Microsoft BI stack and NoSQL tech like Neo4j, R and Python. My strengths lie in integrating multiple technologies for a specific business problem.

I aim to present material that BI consultants and developers can all take away something new to apply to their own work processes. I try to apply knowledge and skills from my previous life as a neuroscientist and as a blindfolded Rubik's Cube world record holder. I am of the belief that, one day, neuroscience and big data will come together in a big way.
