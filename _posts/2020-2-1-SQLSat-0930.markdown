## Title: Eyes on the Prize:  Simple and Effective Dashboard Visualization Techniques
 
**Abstract**:
When done right, data visualization informs users quickly and efficiently with a minimum of distraction.  When done wrong, we end up with spinning 3D pie charts.  In this talk, we will look at techniques for effective dashboard design, minimizing noise and clutter (like spinning 3D pie charts) while providing relevant information to the intended audience.  We will see how different types of charts work, build out rules of thumb around which charts to use, and integrate visuals to create a coherent dashboard image.  When it comes to dashboards, we will compare and contrast dashboards based on their intended uses, such as interactive dashboards versus TV dashboards.  Finally, we will take an awful dashboard and turn it into something which end users will appreciate.

## Title: Introduction to SQL++ for Big Data: Same Language, More Power
 
**Abstract**:
The most popular databases in the world all speak SQL, and almost 60% of Stack Overflow members use SQL. SQL is the query language that dominates when it comes to interacting with data. Data has changed since the 1970s; it’s no longer just stored in flat tables, but as rich, hierarchical object structures like JSON. SQL isn’t dead though, it just needed to evolve a little bit. In this session, you’ll learn about the next iteration of SQL: SQL++. Born from a UCSD research project, SQL++ is backwards-compatible and can work with heterogeneous data, with or without schemas and indexing. It is still the readable, declarative, highly composable language that you’re used to, but with extra super-powers. This session will focus on the enhancements that SQL++ brings, will show some of the databases that are already implementing it (including Couchbase, AsterixDB, Drill), and guidance on why and when to use it. You will enter with SQL skills and leave with big data skills.

## Title: SQL Server Indexing - Practical Solutions
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever created an index on your database to improve performance, and nothing changed? Have you created indexes suggested by the Missing Index DMV or Database Tuning Advisor, and query performance actually got worse? Are you constantly rebuilding your indexes or updating statistics, just for minor, temporary gains in performance? If so, then this session is for you. 

In this session, we’ll discuss how SQL Server selects and uses indexes to improve query performance. We’ll look at how SQL Server chooses a Scan vs. a Seek, why the Missing Index DMVs don’t always give good advice, and how to tell when your databases are over-indexed. We’ll review DMVs and stored procedures that will quickly show how your indexes are being used, and where they can be improved.  After this session, you’ll have the knowledge and tools to properly optimize your indexing strategy and create significant performance gains for your important queries.

## Title: If you use Azure, you must learn Kusto Query Language?
 
**Abstract**:
Kusto is a service for storing and running interactive analytics over Big Data, easy to query using Kusto Query Language (KQL). As we make progress in our migration to cloud, we are learning new ways to monitor and alert on resources and services. Microsoft has consolidated many services under the umbrella of ‘Azure Monitor’. Whether you are ‘detecting and diagnose issues across applications’, ‘correlate infrastructure issues for VMs’, ‘drill into your SQL database monitoring data with Log Analytics’ you will be using ‘Azure Monitor’. Azure Monitor uses a version of the KQL that is suitable for simple log queries but also includes advanced functionality such as aggregations, joins, and smart analytics. Going forward, KQL must be your primary resource for querying the Azure Monitor log.

In this 95% demo session, I will show you some ‘getting started’ tips and a few sophisticated queries using KQL. Come learn about the future of monitoring and investigations of Azure services.

## Title: Keys to a Healthy Relationship with SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Developers and DBAs have had a long, sometimes strained relationship. Some developers see DBAs as roadblocks standing in the way of getting their work shipped; some DBAs see developers as agents of chaos bent on ruining their perfect database environments.

In this talk designed for application and database developers, we’ll talk about why SQL Server behaves the way it does, common database and query design pain points, and how we look for them. With real-world examples and tales of troublesome T-SQL, past and present, you’ll start to get a picture of what to do and not to do in your applications. Along the way, you’ll learn how to build a better relationship with both SQL Server and the DBAs responsible for it.

## Title: Performance Improvements in SQL Server 2019
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft released SQL Server 2019 in November.  The latest version contains several improvements and new features that improve reliability and performance.  First, Accelerated Database Recovery (ADR) completely redesigns the SQL Server database engine recovery process.  This allows the time spent recovering from a crash or rolling back a transaction to be greatly reduced.  ADR also prevents the transaction log from growing during a long-running transaction.  Second, metadata for temporary tables can be stored in in-memory tables.  For tempdb-heavy workloads, this removes a bottleneck and provides an improvement to performance.  Finally, SQL Server 2019 supports the use of persistent-memory (PMEM) devices.  PMEM can be used to persist the transaction log buffer, effectively removing LOGWRITE waits.  Join me for this session to learn about these new features in SQL Server 2019 and how they can make your workload run faster.

## Title: Automating "Excel Hell" with T-SQL
 
**Abstract**:
Truly automate complex monthly SPREADSHEET IMPORTS without monthly code changes!

Right or wrong, spreadsheets still constitute a source of data that many of us have to import every week or month. The trouble is that most spreadsheets aren’t setup to look like an SQL table. Rather, they are setup as multiple dimensions to aid in user readability and that makes column mapping and importing seriously automation resistant.

This “Black Arts” session provides an introduction to a relatively simple method to quickly, easily, and automatically import such spreadsheets and the code to do so frequently requires no changes to be used across multiple disparate spreadsheets. Creation of the necessary staging table and the related mapping is all done automatically and the monthly addition of columns is automatically handled, as well. Some of the pitfalls of more traditional import methods will also be examined.

Don’t let the “Advanced” rating of this session scare you away. We make it simple!

## Title: Tame Your Unruly Data With Constraints
 
**Abstract**:
Bad data comes in many forms: duplicate rows, wrong data type, invalid values, and orphaned or missing foreign keys. Time is wasted cleansing, reviewing and correcting data, not to mention the potential hazards bad data can cause. This introductory presentation will explain the data types and constraints available in SQL Server, and how they can replace or augment business rules that would otherwise be written in application or procedure code. Performance benefits provided by constraints will be demonstrated. We will examine the various system views and procedures that describe constraints and how to use them to document your databases. You will be able to apply this knowledge to your database environments and see significant improvements in data quality, performance, and reliability.

## Title: Introduction to M (a.k.a Power Query)
 
**Abstract**:
When it comes to getting your data into Excel or Power BI, M is your best choice. The M Language (A.K.A Power Query) is a powerful tool for self-service data preparation. However, it's not clear where it fits compared to tools like SSIS or TSQL. It's also not clear what it's limitations are. This session will cover the basics of M and when to use it.

In this session, we'll demonstrate how M is a linear series of transformations, just like a set of steps from a recipe. We'll show how 80% of what you will ever need to do can be done from the GUI. We'll also talk about how to write custom code for that other 20%. By the end of this presentation, you'll be able to take any manual cleanup you do today and turn it into a repeatable process with M.

## Title: Hardware Hints For The SQL DBA - Don't Let Your IT Department Hand You A Big Bag Of Hurt
 
**Abstract**:
Most IT departments are stretched thin and do not usually have the opportunity to fully investigate the true needs of the database infrastructure.  In this session, we will cover a number of aspects that will help the SQL DBA have informed conversations with IT in order to ensure that better decisions are made when it comes to compute and storage hardware in order to deliver improved performance and reduced licensing cost.
This session will also cover some options that the DBA can investigate if they have been handed hardware that is not quite up to par.

## Title: Source Control for Databases: Why You Need It and How To Get Started
 
**Abstract**:
Source control is popular - even required - for managing changes to application code. It allows multiple people to work on the same code base, track changes, manage conflicts, and have one source of truth for code. Could your databases benefit from having all changes to their schema and objects tracked as well?  Absolutely!

Database administrators *and* developers should attend this working demo session to see how to deploy a database to a development system, how to deploy changes from development back to the production database, and how multiple users can interact simultaneously. You'll leave with an understanding of the concepts of source control, sample code to work with, and a cheat sheet of commands to get you through your first day working with source control.

## Title: How to do a Complete SQL Server Assessment
 
**Abstract**:
Completing a full assessment on a SQL Server is essential to learning about not only the current state of the server, but also any area that may be impacting performance or security.  If you have more than one DBA, it is also important to have all the DBA team members review the same areas when completing an assessment.  During this session we will discuss when assessments are useful, what should be included in the assessment as well as how to interpret the results.  We will use a SQL script that will capture all the data needed.  This script will more than 88 data points, including fragmentation of indexes, performance counter values, server and database security information, queries that consume the most CPU time including execution plans as well as many other data points. This session will also cover how to document your findings and recommendations.

## Title: What Developers Need to Know About The Transaction Log
 
**Abstract**:
Every database change is tracked in the transaction log. It's an essential component to keeping database transactions atomic and durable.
As workloads increase, the performance and throughput to the transaction log matters. In fact the throughput of the transaction log can become the biggest category of database waits.
We're going to take a close look at the function of the transaction log, the challenges that developers can face because of it and we'll discuss what developers can do to about it.
