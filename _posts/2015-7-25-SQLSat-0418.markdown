## Title: SSRS Inception: Reporting on Reporting services.
 
**Abstract**:
Still using Reporting Services? Yeah me too! Does this scenario sound familiar? You already have a large SSRS environment but the users still want more reports. You create a new, all singing, all dancing dashboard that removes the need for a bunch of reports, awesome. You launch it and explain to the business  that you are deprecating the old reports. "WAIT! We still need that for Jill in HR to do her end-of-month", or "We might still need that" - these types of comments are what leads to having a load of reports that are not being used.  
 
Wouldn't it be great if you could see who is viewing a report, in what format and how often, all inside your current SSRS environment? With this data wouldn't it then be even better if we could automate a process to email the owner of that report to say "HA! I told you no one looked at this report!". In this session we will look at how we can do all of this and more by mining the SSRS DB.

## Title: What do I need to know about SQL Server platform upgrade? 
 
**Abstract**:
Why Upgrade? 
Data Platform Upgrade topic has been a popular session that I've presented in major conferences like Microsoft Tech-Ed (North America, Europe  India) and SQLbits since 2008. 

In this session, we will overview in depth end-to-end upgrade process that covers the essential phases, steps and issues involved in upgrading SQL Server 2000, 2005, 2008 R2  SQL Server 2012 (with a good overview on 2014 too) by using best practices and available resources. 
A popular session that I have been presenting since the year 2008, in MS Tech-Ed, SQLSaturday  SQLbits UK.
We will cover the complete upgrade cycle, including the preparation tasks, upgrade tasks, and post-upgrade tasks. Real-world examples from my Consulting experience expanding on why  how such a solution.

## Title: Data modeling for data analysis and cubes
 
**Abstract**:
Analysis Services OLAP cubes provide an incredibly powerful platform for the analysis and reporting of complex data. Unfortunately we often find that our source data is not in the right structure to make the best use of the cube’s power. This limits the cube’s functionality, compromises performance and complicates the reports.
In this session we’ll look at a number of different data scenarios that we encounter and explore ways of remodelling the data within the data warehouse to optimize it for cubes and MDX. We’ll see how adding functionality into the ETL layer and data warehouse can have a dramatic effect on the functionality and simplicity of the cube.

## Title: Advanced SSIS Techniques
 
**Abstract**:
As an ETL developer using SQL Server Integration Services have you ever wondered how to:
1.	Import all .csv files from a folder
2.	Replace dynamic SQL using variables in SSIS
3.	How to configure the data flow buffer
4.	Create custom logging solutions
5.	Use a script component as a data flow transformation
This session focuses on advanced techniques that are used in SSIS and is meant for the experienced SSIS developer.  We will focus on tasks and techniques that are native to SSIS 2005-2014 as well as some of the more advanced and vague  properties.  
Attendees must have a good working knowledge of SSIS as well as familiarity with VB.NET or C# as some time will be taken looking at extending SSIS with script tasks and components.
Upon completion of this workshop attendees will be able to:
1.	Import/export multiple sources/destinations
2.	Use an execute SQL task with variables to replace dynamic SQL within a package
3.	Dynamically handle errors within any part of a package
4.

## Title: The first step towards continuous integration for SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Continuous integration (CI) is a development practice that has become widely adopted for the application layer because it allows teams to detect problems quickly and locate errors more easily. By regularly integrating code into a shared repository and automatically verifying it you'll build confidence in your code.

But database CI continues to be a painful, manual process in many projects. There are many reasons for this, most obviously the issue of data persistence, but there are ways to handle these issues.

In this session, I will show you:

-How easy it is to get your SQL Server database changes in source control
-How to set up an automated build process for your databases
-How this process helps you spot and fix errors quicker
-How to produce an artifact you can use for reliable, repeatable deployments in the future

## Title: Machine Learning without a PhD in statisitcs
 
**Abstract**:
Machine learning is the science of making computers act without being unambiguously programmed. Machine learning is something that we use every day when we search and shop on the web and talk to our devices. Microsoft AzureML is a fully-managed cloud service that enables data aware developers to efficiently embed predictive analytics into their applications,  without a PhD in statistics helping organizations use massive data sets and bring all the benefits of the cloud to machine learning. So join Andrew for a practical insight into the fascinating world of Machine Learning, where you can be significantly different but never certain, deviation is normal, and you are amongst friends if you found the above quote funny.

## Title: Beginners Guide to MDX
 
**Abstract**:
Give your queries a multidimensional makeover. In this session we'll look at the structure and basics of MDX, the Multi Dimensional query eXpression language for querying Analysis Services OLAP cubes.

MDX can seem a very daunting language, but when it's broken down into the basics it's easier than you think.

We'll start at the beginning, so you need no previous MDX experience, but it does help to have some experience with cubes. If you already write MDX but struggle with the syntax, then you need to attend this session!

We'll walk through the difference between a member, measure, tuple, set and dimension. Well describe how to decipher a [] from a {} or a (), and we'll look at some of the awesome power that MDX can provide to our reporting.

## Title: Exploring the Microsoft Data Platform  the Changing Role of the DBA
 
**Abstract**:
The Microsoft Data Platform used to be Microsoft SQL Server, now we have a variety of different options spanning on-premises and cloud. With this increasing array of options the role of the DBA is changing, understanding how these technologies compliment each other and what they are will become more important for the DBA as the roles change. 

In this session we will look at Microsoft SQL Server, Azure SQL DB, DocumentDB and Azure Table Storage, all of which can be used to provide a highly effective data platform on which to build applications. I will help you understand what each of the offerings is, how it differs from the others and demonstrate some examples of when you might want to use one over another.

## Title: Tempdb - a database developer's perspective
 
**Abstract**:
Ask the internet for help when you have a performance issue with tempdb and you will find a slew of articles on how to configure and setup tempdb on your server, how many files to use, where to place them on the disk subsystem, even what hardware to use.  But what if you are a developer, with no access or control over the configuration of the server. In this session Kevan explains what tempdb is and what it is used for and leading on from that how you can, through development approaches, control how you use it.  The usage of tempdb will go hand-in-hand with the overall performance of your queries, so do not be surprised if you learn how to make your queries fly at the same time.

## Title: The elephant in the room: Continuous Delivery for Databases
 
**Abstract**:
Let’s talk about constraints. What’s holding you back from achieving Continuous Delivery?

Databases.

If it’s painful, do it often... Your app is automatically integrated, tested and packaged for deployment in minutes. But what about databases?

Of course, databases come with complications and risks. We’ll talk about both the human and technical changes which are necessary to achieve a reliable, nimble, and automated database deployment process.

You’ll learn how to bring Dev and Ops closer together as well as customise established practices and existing toolsets to build a database deployment pipeline and speed up delivery while at the same time protecting the data (and your sanity).

In particular, we’ll look at two alternative solutions to the problem and their relative pros and cons. Declarative/state based development vs purely migrations driven development.

By the end of the session, delegates will have learned not only that this elephant in the room can be tamed, b

## Title: Machine Learning without a PhD in statistics
 
**Abstract**:
Register @ http://manchesterpass.ddns.net/Speaker2.html

Traditional BI has been all about creating consistent data sets fronted with easy to use tools to allow our users to explore data and make decisions. While this still has its place it doesn't cover predictions well nor does it deliver any actionable insight. That gap is starting to be filled by machine learning and while this has been expensive and complex to implement, Azure Machine Learning takes away a lot of this and at low risk. So if you are curious, you know the data you work with and the business you are in let us enlighten you about how this might really transform your business with only the most basic knowledge of statistics!
