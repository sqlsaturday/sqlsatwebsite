## Title: SharePoint Primer for .NET Developers
 
**Abstract**:
This session will cover an introduction of the SharePoint architecture, details on the more common customization and extensibility areas for developers including application pages, JavaScript, event receivers, workflows, web parts, and field types. We will also cover different options for developing composite solutions leveraging SharePoint data and hosting of your applications in SharePoint. Due to the amount of content, this session is mostly at the architectural level. There will be some demos, but there will not be a lot of depth in one particular area. To gain the most value out of this session it is suggested that you be at least an intermediate level web developer and some experience using SharePoint basic functions as an end user.

## Title: Tame Your Unruly Data...With Constraints!
 
**Abstract**:
Never given time or care, never forming good relationships, becoming bloated, corrupt and rife with indistinguishable copies, and all so horrifyingly pervasive in society. But enough about the Kardashians, what about YOUR DATA? If you want to straighten it out and prevent it from going too far in the first place, this session is for you. We will cover constraint basics (not null, check, primary key/unique, foreign keys), provide standard use cases, and address misconceptions about constraint use and performance. We will also look at triggers and application logic and why these are NOT substitutes for (but can effectively complement) good constraint usage. Attendees will enjoy learning how to keep THEIR data off the tabloid page!

## Title: Beyond Plateaux: Optimize SSAS with Best Practices
 
**Abstract**:
Whether we inherit our Analysis Services environments from predecessors or create them - learning as we go - ourselves, we often conclude that performance (processing and / or querying) and functionality can be enhanced. In this session, Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson overviews ways to launch new capabilities, and to propel performance beyond its current plateau, using design best practices to better meet consumer performance and functional needs. This is the initial session of a set of detailed Best Practices presentations.

## Title: Getting Started with MDX: The (Very) Basics
 
**Abstract**:
In this session, led by Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson, we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.

## Title: It’s In There Somewhere!
 
**Abstract**:
FileTable and Statistical Semantic Search In SQL 2012
It’s like having the biggest junk drawer EVER.  That’s often what our “Document Repositories” become.  You know you have that golden nugget of information that you’re searching for, and it’s in there somewhere, but you can’t find it. This session explores a new feature of SQL 2012 called Statistical Semantic Search. It's like having a closet organizer on staff at all times.  While full-text search lets you query the words in a document, semantic search lets you query the meaning of the document. New scenarios we will look into will include automatic tag extraction, related content discovery, and hierarchical navigation across similar content.

We will illustrate terms and concepts such as joins, unions, and set-based operations, and how you can translate them into actual SQL.  If you're an absolute beginner to SQL, or feel overwhelmed by the baggage of computer data models, or would just like to play with Legos, you'll both enjoy and learn something during this session.
