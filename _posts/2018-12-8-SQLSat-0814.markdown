## Title: BI Infrastructure in Azure: Points to Consider
 
**Abstract**:
Success of a good BI infrastructure is measured by two most important factors: 
a) Better access to data and 
b) Increased operational efficiency
How can you set up your own BI infrastructure in the cloud to address these? 
What components do we consider?
We can do that by proper selection of technology and vendors from Azure Market Place. How do we keep an eye on possible use of Big Data for your BI. We will also look at the best practices for doing so. We will take a fleeting look at some of the storage options for us in Azure and some Big Data concepts as well.
We will learn about Copy Data Virtualization in Azure Market Place that can help you provision terabytes worth of information in matter of minutes. 
We will also learn about setting up teams and ways to train them(and yourself) in this fast evolving world of Azure.

## Title: Networking 101: Building professional relationships
 
**Abstract**:
Networking.  You keep hearing that word throughout your career development, but you don't know much about it, much less, how to do it.  You want to connect with technical and data professionals, so you attend events such as SQLSaturday and your local user group.  But what about your book club, your gym, your church group, or your kid's soccer game?  Those are prime -- and overlooked -- opportunities to network!

In this interactive session, we will discuss networking -- what it is, why it's important, and where opportunities exist.  You will even have an opportunity to practice networking within the confines of our room.  You might even leave this session with new networking contacts that you didn't previously have!

## Title: Data Profiling or Statistics 201
 
**Abstract**:
Any new database design, normalization process or just simple research starts from data profiling. At first you determine number of rows in the data set. After that you run multiple similar queries against each column to determine Max and Min values, maximum length for text columns, number of nulls, distribution of data, and more.
When all these queries are already pre-set or dynamic or you are doing profiling via SQL Server Data Tools, it is not a problem on relatively small data set, but what if your table contains billions of records, and stretches for multiple gigabytes? All queries against that large data set will do a full table scan, which will produce very heavy I/O, and take forever.
In order to make the process faster, we will use a hidden gem of SQL Server:  Statistics. Only one table scan will be needed to generate them, and then we can use the science behind them to do research over our data.

## Title: Eyes on the Prize:  Simple and Effective Dashboard Visualization Techniques
 
**Abstract**:
When done right, data visualization informs users quickly and efficiently with a minimum of distraction.  When done wrong, we end up with spinning 3D pie charts.  In this talk, we will look at techniques for effective dashboard design, minimizing noise and clutter (like spinning 3D pie charts) while providing relevant information to the intended audience.  We will see how different types of charts work, build out rules of thumb around which charts to use, and integrate visuals to create a coherent dashboard image.  When it comes to dashboards, we will compare and contrast dashboards based on their intended uses, such as interactive dashboards versus TV dashboards.  Finally, we will take an awful dashboard and turn it into something which end users will appreciate.

## Title: Enter the Tidyverse:  R for the Data Professional
 
**Abstract**:
In this day-long training, you will learn about R, the premiere language for data analysis.  We will approach the language from the standpoint of data professionals:  database developers, database administrators, and data scientists.  We will see how data professionals can translate existing skills with SQL to get started with R.  We will also dive into the tidyverse, an opinionated set of libraries which has modernized R development.  We will see how to use libraries such as dplyr, tidyr, and purrr to write powerful, set-based code.  In addition, we will use ggplot2 to create production-quality data visualizations.

Over the course of the day, we will look at several problem domains.  For database administrators, areas of note will include visualizing SQL Server data, predicting error occurrences, and estimating backup times for new databases.  We will also look at areas of general interest, including analysis of open source data sets.

## Title: Big data architectures and the data lake
 
**Abstract**:
With so many new technologies it can get confusing on the best approach to building a big data architecture.  The data lake is a great new concept, usually built in Hadoop, but what exactly is it and how does it fit in?  In this presentation I’ll discuss the four most common patterns in big data production implementations, the top-down vs bottoms-up approach to analytics, and how you can use a data lake and a RDBMS data warehouse together.  We will go into detail on the characteristics of a data lake and its benefits, and how you still need to perform the same data governance tasks in a data lake as you do in a data warehouse.  Come to this presentation to make sure your data lake does not turn into a data swamp!

## Title: Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere
 
**Abstract**:
Today, many organizations have already virtualized most of their non critical applications, these organizations are now employing a "Virtual First" policy, harnessing the efficiency and cost savings of virtualization for their most critical applications. 
Still, many IT architects and DBA's are hesitant of virtualizing their SQL workloads, they are worried about  performance, scale, availability and support for what is usually considered their most critical applications.  In this session we will review the guidance for successfully virtualizing critical SQL databases, we will cover the best practices, real world customer experience  and what to watch out for when virtualizing the most critical SQL databases. The session is delivered by a member of the VMware's SQL Server Experts Group.

## Title: Pocket-sized SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
With a growing focus on large data solutions that span terabytes and use dozens of CPUs and vast amounts of memory, sometimes the smaller solutions are overlooked, especially when considering the Internet of Things where often you may want data collection close to the data you're collecting.
At the other end of the spectrum there's an amazing amount of power available in very small form-factors. This session will explore what can be done with cheap off the shelf "computers on a board" form factors and Linux to build cheap and easy to deploy small SQL solutions that can be useful for a variety of data collection activities.

## Title: Keeping Your DBA Happy. Why Some Practices Drive Admins Crazy.
 
**Abstract**:
Ever used a NOLOCK hint, only to find that nothing broke the next day? Odds are most folks reading this have. So if fire and brimstone did not rain from the sky, why do we worry so much about this hint? What could actually go wrong?

SQL Server supports two table types - heaps and tables with clustered indexes. We almost always create a unique clustered index on tables ... but why? Since heaps are part of the product they must have a use case but what is it? Any what is the secret sauce in clustered indexes that makes them so popular?

There is a substantial body of best practice information in the SQL Server community. Many of these practices are routinely ignored in some organizations, presumably because the consequences of not following aren't always clear. Come join this full day session for in-depth explanations of _why_ we give some of the advice that we do.

Query hints, indexing, LINQ to Entities, common table expressions, looping vs set-based operations and more

## Title: What about the Data Dude? SSDT Database Projects
 
**Abstract**:
For years the database has been treated as a second class citizen when it comes to source, change, and version control, often thought of as a dumb data store. Microsoft first addressed this with Visual Studio Team System 2008 Database Edition, aka "Data Dude". After the release of Visual Studio 2012, Microsoft pulled the database project out of Visual Studio and created SQL Server Data Tools as separate, free to SQL Server users, install on top of the Visual Studio shell. The database project was updated making managing databases as code much easier and making the database a first class citizen in the code world. We will cover how to create a database project, connect it to source control, and deploy to our database servers.

## Title: Always Encrypted for Beginners
 
**Abstract**:
One of the biggest challenges to successful implementation of data encryption has been the back and forth between the application and the database.  You have to overcome the obstacle of the application decrypting the data it needs.  Microsoft tried to simplify this process when it introduced Always Encrypted (AE) into SQL Server 2016 and Azure SQL Database.  In this demo intense session, you will learn about what Always Encrypted is, how it works, and the implications for your environment. By the end you will know how to now easily encrypt columns of data and just as importantly how to unencrypt. You will also learn about the current limitations of the feature and what your options are to work around them.

## Title: Azure Managed Instances: A Primer
 
**Abstract**:
So you’ve heard about Azure SQL Database – you probably watched a demo and chat on that when Mike shared it last year! You’ve probably heard about Azure Managed Instances, Also. What are they? How easy are they to set up? What does it cost? How do we take advantage of it? Will SQL Agent jobs and all that “instance level stuff” I worry about with Azure SQL DB come over?

Come to this session and find out. We’ll do some obligatory slides talking about use case, the pros, the cons and compare it with other services out there (Amazon RDS, Azure SQL, etc) and then we’ll spend a lot of time doing an interactive demo where we will build an Azure SQL Managed Instance, deploy to it and interact with our instance of SQL up in the cloud.

## Title: Dimensional Modeling Design patterns beyond the basics
 
**Abstract**:
Dimensional modeling is arguably one of the most important fundamentals of business intelligence. It is still relevant even as new technologies like Power BI and SSAS Tabular Models are becoming standard. Correctly modeling your organization's data not only protects the most important asset your company has but ensures that your data mart or data warehouse will be responsive and capable of accommodating emerging requirements. This session provides a deeper dive into the art of dimensional modeling. We will look at the different types of fact tables and dimension tables, how and when to use them. We will also some approaches to creating rich hierarchies that make reporting a snap. Finally we will cover physical design choices.This case study and demo based session promises to be very interactive and engaging, bring your toughest Dimensional Modeling quandaries.

## Title: SQL Server Indexing for Developers and Accidental DBAs
 
**Abstract**:
So you have been tasked with making that query faster. You know that indexes often can help with query performance, but how do you even start going about it.

Join Sebastian Meine, Ph.D. for this truly interactive session and discover how indexes in SQL Server work. After attending, you’ll be able to answer common index questions, like:

- Which columns should I add to my index?
- How many indexes should I add to my new table?
- Does the column order in my index have to match that in my query?
- Does it hurt to have too many indexes?
- When should I consolidate Indexes?
- Are there queries that get slower after I create an index?

But even more important, you’ll be able to explain how indexes are organized in SQL Server and what mechanism is responsible for the amazing performance gains you can achieve with them.

## Title: SQL Graph
 
**Abstract**:
Graphs are everywhere!  Microsoft has added a lot of new features to SQL Server 2017 (and 2019), and among them SQL Graph has been one - one that holds a lot of promises, though it's still in its early stages (at least with Microsoft's offering).  Microsoft added SQL Graph features to their 2017 release, and has added support for MERGE (UPSERT) scenarios to ease insertions into edge tables, and Edge Constraints to apply restrictions on relationships between nodes in 2019 release (in CTP 2.0).  In this session, we'll take a look at what this feature brings to the table, and how it compares with other Graph databases.

## Title: Cleaning Is Half The Battle: Launching A Data Science Project
 
**Abstract**:
There's an old adage in software development: Garbage In, Garbage Out. This adage certainly applies to data science projects: if you simply throw raw data at models, you will end up with garbage results. In this session, we will build an understanding of just what it takes to implement a data science project whose results are not garbage. We will use the Microsoft Team Data Science Process as our model for project implementation, learning what each step of the process entails. To motivate this walkthrough, we will see what we can learn from a survey of data professionals' salaries.

## Title: SQL Restore: Optimizing Your Data Recovery
 
**Abstract**:
When disaster strikes, everyone's immediate question becomes: How long until the system is back online?  Whether it's a single database or the whole SQL environment, time is essential... As everyone waits on the restore to complete. 

How long will the restoration process take?  
Can it run faster? 

In this session, we'll answer these questions by looking at how to establish and maintain a Restoration Baseline and the options available for performance tuning database restores.

Hi, my name is Jason I'm a practice lead at Redapt. I spend most of my day helping clients solve business problems mostly in the Data and Advanced Analytics spaces. Sometimes this involves various and sundry cloud technologies including Azure Data Factory, Azure SQL Data Warehouse, Azure Data Lake Store, Azure Databricks, HDInsight and Azure SQL Database. I'm fluent in several languages including: SQL, C#, Python, and PowerShell.

I'm a Microsoft Certified Master of SQL Server (MCM) and have been recognized for my technical excellence and evangelism efforts by Microsoft by being awarded the Most Valuable Professional (MVP) for the last 5+ years.

In my off hours I like to snowboard, karaoke, ride roller coasters, and play arcade games
