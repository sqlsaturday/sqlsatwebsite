## Title: Daily indexing problems and its - possible - solution
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever been in the situation that an application performed well the last day and - suddenly - you run into problems? Although you have Index Maintenance jobs and statistics up to date you will monitor a big degrade of performance! This session will demonstrate in a over 80 percent demo based presentation the following scenarios which happend this way in real life!
- Why performance degradation in spite of maintenance jobs?
- just one more database in the result set and the query runs really bad - why?
- usage of literals is completely different from the usage of variables - why?
- identical data types but the query runs in part perfect and in part bad...
- your execution plan shows an INDEX SEEK - but the table will be scanned!
- you get a query from the business which performs really bad but when you test it it runs pretty cool - why?

## Title: Automating the deployment of Linux VMs with SQL Server through Ansible
 
**Abstract**:
With the recent technological evolution caused by the growth of the cloud, as well as by the open-source revolution at Microsoft, new challenges and tasks have emerged. Functions such as Data Engineer and Cloud Engineer become more and more common and requested.
In an environment with high-scale needs and agility in the processes, it became imperative to use some kind of automation, in order to meet the demand in an intelligent and standardized way.
In this session, I will show you how Ansible can help us create VMs on Azure, adjust their settings and install a SQL Server instance. All of this in a scalable and consistent way. With the automation, you will be moved from lead actor to a mere spectator, but you will still be the protagonist :)

## Title: The Untruthful Art - Five Ways of Misrepresenting Data
 
**Abstract**:
In this age of information it is imperative to be able to be able to clearly, simply and accurately explain and communicate sometimes complex data. 
Right at the intersection of journalism and statistics lies visual communication - the art of using data, charts and maps to convey information. This has been called "the truthful art" as it is an extremely powerful tool that must be wielded with the utmost care. 
Just like any other tools, however, it can be used for sinister purposes. This session is all about exploring ways that data can be misrepresented to further a goal - while still seem perfectly reasonable. It is intended as an eye opener for anyone interested in the how and why of data deception. We will walk through five stories and explore where the trickery is hidden, discuss a more honest way to communicate the information as well as look at ways to spot potential foul play with data.

## Title: My Power BI Report is Slow: What Should I Do?
 
**Abstract**:
You created a wonderful Power BI report, but when you open it you wait too much time. Changing a slicer selection is also slow. Where should you start analyzing the problem? What can you do to optimize performance?

This session will guide you in analyzing the possible reasons for a slow Power BI report. By using Task Manager and DAX Studio, you will be able to determine whether you should change the report layout, or if there is something in DAX formulas or in the data model that is responsible for the slow response.

At the end of this session, you will understand how to locate a performance bottleneck in a Power BI report, so you will focus your attention on the biggest issue.

## Title: Secure multiparty Machine Learning with SQL Server Always Encrypted with Secure Enclaves
 
**Abstract**:
Preserving privacy when processing data from multiple sources with machine learning is always a 
challenge. Organizations want to perform collaborative data analytics while guaranteeing the privacy of their individual datasets. Combining multiple data sources to support a better outcome improves accuracy of prediction, but it may come at cost of confidentiality, if sensitive information is not accurately protected.
SQL Server 2019 adds new data security capabilities with Always Encrypted with Secure Enclaves. By using trusted execution environments (TEEs) to protect your data while in use, you can use machine learning algorithms across different organizations to better train models, without revealing the processed data.
This session presents the benefits of Confidential Computing in an ML scenario, where separate health institutes collaborate on data analysis and prediction using Azure ML.

## Title: Exploring Window Functions
 
**Abstract**:
Window Functions first emerged with the 2005 release – and were enhanced in 2012.
They provide a window over the result set and the ability to access data other than the current row.
This means that somethings that may  - at first - seem like they need row-by-row processing can be done in one single set-based query.
The set of window functions available also includes server analytical functions that give the ability to perform statistical analysis.
Come along to this session and see a deep dive into window functions and learn how their use will add to your ability to process data and write more efficient – and cleaner – queries.
