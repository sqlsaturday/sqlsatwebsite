## Title: Advanced SQL Server 2005 Reporting Services
 
**Abstract**:
In this presentation I would present some of the more arcane aspects of SSRS including advanced charting, using custom code in reports, subreports and navigation internally and externally in Reporting services. I have been a trainer in the past and I've found it best that when I've made presentations my usual rule is to not allow any questions during the presentation, this avoids "presentation hi-jacking" by some attendees.  I aim at having at least the last quarter hour for questions.  I aim for above all an instructional and entertaining time.

## Title: DBA Repository, 2008 SSRS Overlay and Gantt Chart
 
**Abstract**:
This idea delivers a series of SSRS 2008 reports added to the DBA Repository. One is a working Gantt chart for reporting on SQL Server Agent schedules. I like to call this an "overlay" report, like the old days of the overhead projector where transparencies could be combined in chart form to show time-differentiated values or conicidence. This is vital to a DBA so that he or she can see when jobs overlap on all servers that may cause contention for resources. This is ideal for creating the best-fit schedule for existing jobs or answering scheduling decisions with future jobs. The presentation will cover the follow technologies specific to the popular DBA Repository: SSIS (2008), Reporting Services (2008), and new gauge and range style repor

## Title: Intro to SQL Server 2008 Full Text Searching

Give your users search capabilities into their data. It's as easy as 1-2-3!

In this session, the attendees will learn not only how to use the standard full text search functionality, but how to customize the built in list of “noise words”, to be able to add and remove words that should or should not be ignored. In addition attendees will also learn how to customize the thesaurus for their own needs. DBAs will also find helpful queries

## Title: What Greeen and Sustainability Mean to SQL
 
**Abstract**:
Professionals, and Why You Should Care.

SQL Professionals have the opportunity to be in the front lines in the Green and Sustainability effort.

"Green and Sustainability" encompasses more than just energy conservation, although on that front the new tools in SQL Server 2008 are huge contributors to the Green effort to reduce bits sent across the pipe.

When you add keystroke saving and time saving to the Green and Sustainability effort, SQL Server 2008 can contribute significant metrics to the war on bits (can you say SSIS and SSRS)!

Come to this interactive session to brainstorm with other interested people, hear how Green starts with how you do what you do (Be Green); hear about the opportunities associated with green (Build Gr

## Title: XML Features in SQL 2005
 
**Abstract**:
XML in SQL 2000 wasn't very exciting and it was easy to dismiss it altogether by just relying on developers to handle any XML needed within the application. SQL 2005 changes the game and this session will show you how to use the new XML data type, do basic XML operations on XML data, and showcase the changes to FOR XML that make it so much more useful. This isn't a session to convince you to use XML, but to show you what you can do with XML if you do need to use it!

Database Administrator by day and Author by night Brandie Tarvin sails pirate-populated waters, fights evil robots in disguise and turns kingdoms into chaotic rebellious city-states all while coding ETL processes and protecting real-world data from corruption. If it weren't for her, someone else would have the job and where would be the fun in that?

Brandie's first computer experience was with a State-of-the-Art Commodore 64 brought home by her father, who informed her that "computers are NOT toys" and would not let her use it until she learned how to program. In late 2003, she turned her hobbies of programming, MUSHing and assisting friends with generic tech support into a full time career as a database administrator. She's been stuck in the fabulous and bizarre world of professional IT work ever since.

Currently, Brandie is a Database Administrator  Developer for Allstate Dealer Services in Jacksonville. She has published several articles on SQLServerCentral.com, trains her co-workers in SQL Server, and has previously presented at several SQLSaturday events and JSSUG meetings. She also writes fiction and freelances for Catalyst Game Labs in her spare time.
