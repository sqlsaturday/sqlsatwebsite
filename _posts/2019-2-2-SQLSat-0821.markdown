## Title: Getting Started with Apache Spark
 
**Abstract**:
As companies work to gain insight from ever-increasing amounts of data, data platform practitioners need tools which can scale along with the data.  Early big data solutions in the Hadoop ecosystem assumed that data sizes overwhelmed available memory, emphasizing heavy disk usage to coordinate work between nodes.  As the cost of memory decreases and the amount of memory available per server increases, we see a shift in the makeup of big data systems, emphasizing heavy memory usage instead of disk.  Apache Spark, which focuses on memory-intensive operations, has taken advantage of this hardware shift to become the dominant solution for problems requiring distributed data.  In this talk, we will take an introductory look at Apache Spark.  We will review where it fits in the Hadoop ecosystem, cover how to get started and some of the basic functional programming concepts needed to understand Spark, and see examples of how we can use Spark to solve issues like calculating PageRank.

## Title: Using Extended Events for Wait Stats Analysis
 
**Abstract**:
When troubleshooting overall server performance, wait statistics are a great place to start. But when your SQL Server hosts a complex set of workloads, it can be difficult to narrow down which queries are causing the most wait, and what types of wait they are causing. Fortunately, SQL Server provides easy ways for targeting which queries are causing you the most wait time. In this session, we’ll learn how to use both Extended Events, and Dynamic Management Views for examining wait statistics from the instance level to the database level, all the way down to the individual query level. We’ll analyze poorly performing queries using a combination of methods including T-SQL queries and SQL 2017’s new XEvent Profiler, and show how to quickly narrow down what SQL Server is waiting for, and why.

## Title: Azure Data Studio - The Open-Source, Cross-Platform, Cloud Database Tool for SQL
 
**Abstract**:
Azure Data Studio (formerly SQL Operations Studio) is the modern, cross-platform database management tool for SQL Server, both on-premise and in the cloud.  A simple, clean approach to a UI creates an experience different from other SQL management tools today.  Fully integrated intellisense with customizable code-snippets, connection management, and dashboards, Azure Data Studio, provides the T-SQL editor experience most of us expect today.  Unlike other tools, Azure Data Studio is 100% open-source, easily extensible, and has full integration to modern source control solutions like GIT.
In this session, we introduce Azure Data Studio and interacting with SQL Server environments.  We will focus on productivity comparable to SSMS, shortcuts and time savers, as well as how to leverage source control.  Lastly, we will cover extending Azure Data Studio by setting up a development environment, and walking through the process of build and debugging a custom dashboard component, using Electro

## Title: SQL Server Transactional Replication: A Deeper Dive
 
**Abstract**:
Transactional replication in SQL Server is not a new, shiny technology. In fact, a lot of people will tell you it's an old one full of nightmares. But don't be too quick to judge; replication still offers a lot of benefits, and  most of the problems you might encounter can be quickly diagnosed and fixed if you have a deeper understanding of replication internals.

In this session, we'll discuss the transactional replication model and what it offers. You'll see plenty of examples of how to monitor transactions as they get from your publishers to your subscribers. There will also be examples of how you can change the behavior of your transactions too, and what benefits (and potential pitfalls) these changes offer.

Finally, you'll see examples on how to configure transactional replication in high availability scenarios.

## Title: “Black Arts” Index Maintenance #2: Better Methods that Can Actually Prevent Fragmentation for Weeks.
 
**Abstract**:
Most people don’t know it but the current “Best Practice” Methods are actually the leading cause of perpetual logical and physical fragmentation, costly and continuous “Bad” page splits, comparatively insane amounts of log file generation and, in an interesting “Catch 22”, the whole reason for why we have to do so much index maintenance.

This isn’t your typical presentation on Index Maintenance.

In this second of two back-to-back sessions, we’ll learn of several incredibly easy modifications to your Index Maintenance routines to actually prevent fragmentation for weeks rather than perpetuating it,  virtually eliminate “Bad” page splits, reduce wasted memory, make your log file and log file backups a whole lot more happy, and increase the overall performance of even perfect code.

We’ll also learn that no simple method is a panacea, what to do about the horror of "expAnsive" updates, and how to make even GUID-keyed indexes work well.

## Title: Encrypting Data within Sql Server
 
**Abstract**:
Data breaches abound! Do you want to keep off of the data breach list? What are some of the data privacy laws affecting you? How will encrypting data affect your database performance? What data fields should you encrypt?  What else can you do to protect your sensitive data?

In this session, we will review each option to encrypt data within SQL Server, Transparent Data Encryption, Cell Level Encryption and Always Encrypted. The session will deep dive into setting up Always Encrypted encryption and share my experiences implementing the encryption. In addition, the session will review auditing of sensitive data usage.  

You will leave the session with a deeper understanding about SQL Server encryption options and how encryption can affect your performance.  In addition, you will gather information on how to fully protect and review your sensitive data usage.

## Title: Introduction to M (a.k.a Power Query)
 
**Abstract**:
When it comes to getting your data into Excel or Power BI, M is your best choice. The M Language (A.K.A Power Query) is a powerful tool for self-service data preparation. However, it's not clear where it fits compared to tools like SSIS or TSQL. It's also not clear what it's limitations are. This session will cover the basics of M and when to use it.

In this session, we'll demonstrate how M is a linear series of transformations, just like a set of steps from a recipe. We'll show how 80% of what you will ever need to do can be done from the GUI. We'll also talk about how to write custom code for that other 20%. By the end of this presentation, you'll be able to take any manual cleanup you do today and turn it into a repeatable process with M.

## Title: Taming of the Shrew - Optimizing Power BI
 
**Abstract**:
No one wants to tell a report user that while running a report in Power BI they have time to go get a cup of coffee…in another town.  Although data sets will often be the focus of performance issues, it’s important to know how to locate performance problems in Power BI and how to eliminate them.  

This session will take the Power User through how to identify time consuming processing in Power BI and how to address it through step-by-step and proven methods used to optimize in multi-tier environments.  This method removes frustration and finger-pointing and gets to the heart of the problem with a goal of correcting performance challenges.  The results are satisfied end users who get the information they need, when they need it.

Take Aways:
Learn how to identify what is taking the time in a Power BI data set and report.
Understand the logging and tracing mechanisms and capabilities in the environment.
Understand when a problem is really a problem.

## Title: Infrastructure for the DBA: An Introduction
 
**Abstract**:
It doesn’t matter if you are a Junior DBA, an accidental DBA or all the way up to a Senior DBA, the infrastructure your SQL Server environment runs on is important.  Many among the DBA community came in as developers or perhaps directly into database administration roles it is equally possible that you have been out of the operations world long enough to have fallen out of the loop with what is happening.  This session is intended to provide a full stack infrastructure overview so that you can talk shop with your cohorts in operations to resolve issues and maybe even be proactive.  We will discuss, in an introductory fashion, hardware, network, storage, virtualization and operating system layers.  Additionally, some suggestions as to where to find more information will be provided.

## Title: Why do I need Analysis Services?
 
**Abstract**:
Do you have or are you developing a BI roadmap without Analysis Services? Do you write a lot of SSRS reports with SQL queries, views or stored procedures? Have you heard about Analysis Services but don't know if it's a good fit for you? Are you trying to decide whether you should go with Tabular or OLAP? Are you thinking about using Power BI? Are your business users hungry for data? If you answered yes to any of these questions, you probably need Analysis Services.

In this session we will go over use cases for Analysis Services and highlight the differences and strengths of each flavor of SSAS. We will review typical BI architectures and show how adding Analysis Services can turn your report users into happy and self sufficient data analysts. If you have a data warehouse(or even if you don't) and aren't using SSAS, come learn how SSAS will make your users love you.

## Title: “Black Arts” Index Maintenance #1: How the “Best Practice” Methods are Silently Killing Performance
 
**Abstract**:
Most people don’t know it but the current “Best Practice” Methods are actually the leading cause of perpetual logical and physical fragmentation, costly and continuous “Bad” page splits, comparatively insane amounts of log file generation and, in an interesting “Catch 22”, the whole reason for why we have to do so much index maintenance.

This isn’t your typical presentation on Index Maintenance.

In this first of two back-to-back sessions on the subject, we’ll explore what happens to an index in the first year of its life for four different common Fill Factors along with how “Best Practice” methods executed once per week and once per day have their way with you, your indexes, your log files, wasted memory, and the performance of your code even if it’s perfect code.

## Title: The Data-Professional’s Junk Drawer
 
**Abstract**:
There is at least one in your home right now, a box, a basket, a bucket, perhaps even actually drawer; hastily organized at best but full of tools, gadgets, widgets and whatchamacallits designed for one or two specific purposes.  Realistically, we all want to use the more generic, multipurposed item found in our “well organized place for storing things”, yet deep down we know that tool/gadget/widget etc. is really what we need.  As data-professionals, we are all familiar with the largest “junk drawer” ever created, the Internet.  In this session, we will discuss some tools which are not data specific, the jobs they do well, and where to find them.  Join as us as explore Robocopy, parts of the SysInterals Suite, a connection manager or two, portables apps aplenty and more so that you can move that file more efficiently, troubleshoot that problem through a different lens, or simply know what the heck someone else is talking about.

## Title: PowerShell for the DBA
 
**Abstract**:
PowerShell is a tool used by many people in DevOps and Infrastructure. Should the DBA get on board with using PowerShell? The answer is yes - as a DBA, PowerShell can have a significant impact on tasks that would be long and tedious with just T-SQL alone. Today there are specific modules that can be incorporated into PowerShell to help in automating every-day DBA tasks. Beyond that, PowerShell can be used to do things like automate deployments and audit permissions. 

In this session we will explore real-world examples and demonstrate how PowerShell can be leveraged by the DBA to not only improve efficiency but also streamline processes across an enterprise environment.

## Title: I Want To Go Faster! An Introduction To Indexing
 
**Abstract**:
You’ve heard of indexes and have tried creating them in the past.  However, instead of experiencing faster execution times, you saw little performance improvement and were left wondering if you indexed the right columns and whether you would have been better off building an index for every column in your table instead (hint: probably not).

In this session you will learn the basics of creating performance improving indexes. We will discuss how to identify when a performance problem is due to a missing or poorly defined index, the secrets that allow indexes to make your queries run faster, and examples of how to create performance improving indexes for common querying scenarios.

Whether you are a new DBA wanting to speed up the queries on your servers or a developer looking to make their applications run faster, this introduction to indexing will have you covered.

## Title: Learn History from Temporal Tables
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2016 came out with a bucket full of cool new features. One of them is Temporal Tables. SQL Server 2017 made some enhancements in this area. Temporal tables are basically history tables of the normal tables; that allows us to retrieve data from any point in time for every change such as updates and deletes. It does this all without any change to application code and without needing any triggers. In this session, we will see what the requirements of creating temporal tables are. We will see the demo on insert and update functionality and how to query historical information using new TSQL clause. We will touch upon retention of history as well. It has lots of demos and less theory.

## Title: Are you following SQL Server Development Best Practices?
 
**Abstract**:
Coding is always a fun but challenging job. Developers do not only have to execute the right output based on the business requirement but also need to maintain right coding standards by using the optimum use of variable sizes and keeping in view the other best practices. The session will cover the key best practices which developers can follow and get benefited.
Many of us already may have been using these steps already but for those who are new to the development process or want to brush up, the session is for you.

## Title: "Full Text indexing!" or..."What is that service I never turn on?"
 
**Abstract**:
If you've ever wondered what that other service is in your configuration manager then this is the class for you.  Full text indexing allows you to write queries to scan large text fields without having to do a complete table scan every time.

We'll talk about installing, setting up, maintaining, and using full text indexes to their fullest!

## Title: I have Indexes, but do I have the Right Indexes?
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server indexes come in multiple types: clustered, non-clustered, full text and column store. In this session, you’ll get an understanding of what these types are and when each is an appropriate solution. We will explain and demonstrate each type, and you’ll leave this class with a repeatable indexing methodology you can use to improve your database performance.

## Title: Applying Data Warehousing Principles
 
**Abstract**:
Many data analysts typically begin to work with data as a single flat table. While this works for small datasets, as the size of the data grows these naive methods do not scale. Processing records takes longer, queries become more complex, and introducing new datasets is inconsistent at best. In order to solve these problems, we must take into account the underlying architecture of our data and how it should be modeled. During this talk we will discuss key concepts, patterns, and techniques for designing a data model that is simple to query, scales with your data, and is extendable to new datasets.

## Title: Pester your SQL Servers!
 
**Abstract**:
As DBAs blur the lines between automation and software engineering, they must also employ sound software engineering principals.  One of these key principals is testing.  And just as you can automate DBA tasks, the same automation can be extended to unit testing.

This session will explore the PowerShell unit testing module Pester and how it can be applied to the automation code that a DBA creates.  We'll cover the basics of Pester and how it can be employed by DBAs.

This session will work through some light demos.  Familiarity with SQL Server database administration and PowerShell is helpful but not required.

## Title: Power BI with Maps: Choose Your Destination
 
**Abstract**:
A childhood dream to travel around the world fueled by reading Gulliver's Travels stories and Robinson Crusoe attempts to survive on a deserted island. Those books were filled with geographical description and map locations. I think I always loved working with maps and I still do! There is something that could captivate your mind and propel your imagination for traveling when you immerse yourself in maps.
