## Title: SQL Server Internals:  It's What's for Dinner!
 
**Abstract**:
Ever wondered what happens under the hood when you query your SQL Server database? Well, it’s somewhat like asking for a special meal for dinner. During this session, I will use a chef analogy to describe the life cycle of a query and the journey it takes through SQL Server’s working parts. By comparing the concepts of SQL Internals to a familiar idea, you will have a clear understanding of the underlying processes involved in returning data from a SELECT query. Once we’ve established a frame of reference for a simple read operation, we’ll look at an UPDATE statement and consider the additional factors associated with a write operation.  By session's end you should have a clear overview of what happens when a query hits your server.

## Title: What To Do When It All Goes So Wrong
 
**Abstract**:
As IT Professionals we inevitably will see situations where everything goes wrong. At times we are somewhat lucky and this just means diminished functionality or a slow system. Other times our organization is temporarily out of business. Regardless of the scope of the issue, how we react can have a direct impact on how quickly things are returned to normal. This session will cover how to communicate issues, including what to say, who to say it to and when to say it. Part of managing communication is to get everyone into a room, forcing them to talk, so time will be spent on designing an effective war room. The session will also cover how by setting out to prove that an issue is ours we are able to more quickly get at a root cause.

## Title: SQL Server Storage: Filegroups, Files, Partitions
 
**Abstract**:
It’s hard to find good information about SQL Server storage. Should you put data and log files on different drives when they’re on a SAN? How do you know when to add more data files? Is there an advantage to using multiple filegroups? Brent’s a former SAN administrator and wrote the storage chapter of Professional SQL Server 2008 Internals and Troubleshooting. He’s got the answers you’re looking for, and he’ll help demystify what SQL Server’s doing inside the black box. Attendees will learn why you shouldn’t add files to an existing filegroup, how to get faster performance from TempDB, and how to check your file performance using DMVs.

## Title: Baselines First, Troubleshooting Second
 
**Abstract**:
“The system is slow. It was much faster last week! This is taking forever.” Statements like these from users can be frustrating for any DBA, unless you have the data to prove how the system regularly performs. In this session we will cover some of the tools and techniques freely available to SQL Server DBAs for capturing baselines that can be used for measuring performance, capacity planning and understanding usage patterns. We also discuss how these utilities and their data can be used to identify warning signs and troubleshoot performance issues. Tools covered include: PerfMon, PAL, Profiler, ClearTrace, RMLUtils, who_is_active and SQL Server DMVs

## Title: Raise the Bar by Writing Professional Database Cod
 
**Abstract**:
As protectors of arguably, the most important asset companies’ have we are tasked with ensuring quality, security and performance.  However the ways in which we utilize and obtain those assets are often not formalized and therefore suffer from degraded quality.  Let's discuss some strategies that can be implemented to not only raise the bar of quality, but also make you sleep easier at night.

## Title: Index Internals for Mere Mortals
 
**Abstract**:
Most DBA's have heard of indexes, but not everyone understands how they work.  In this in-depth session, Michelle will cover the internals of indexes, including index filtering and partitioning.  She'll compare the B-trees of different index types, explain fragmentation, and use undocumented commands to show you what an actual index page looks like.  Attendees will walk away with a much better understanding of indexes, which is helpful when designing and tuning databases.  If you've ever wondered just *what* goes on in an index, this is the session for you!

## Title: The Script Task, powerhouse of SSIS
 
**Abstract**:
Everyday more DBAs and SQL developers are given responsibility for ETL development. They have a strong SQL background with little or no .Net language programming experience. As they progress with SSIS, they can come up against perceived limitations in the capabilities of SSIS using only the built-in tasks. What they may not realize is the extensibility available to SSIS via the Script Task. This presentation will provide them with the tools they need to move beyond that perceived limitation.

## Title: Windows Failover Clustering Basics for the DBA
 
**Abstract**:
While you can see how to deploy a failover cluster in 60 minutes, what a DBA really needs is a solid foundation of Windows to truly be able to understand that implementation and its subsequent administration. This session will demystify the Windows layer of clustering and present it from a DBA focus. Using Windows Server 2008 R2, some of the topics that will be shown are: failover cluster validation and its impact on installing SQL Server, a tour of the new Failover Cluster Manager and how it can be used for administration, using the new cluster logs for troubleshooting, and more.

## Title: Monitoring Data Changes with Change Data Capture
 
**Abstract**:
Most modern enterprise database environments require some measure of auditing their data. Previously, the DBA would need to put together a complicated web of triggers and history tables in order to properly track data changes. Now in SQL Server 2008, Change Data Capture allows the DBA to readily enact a very straight-forward method for tracking the changes and understanding easily how they took place. In this session, we will examine how to set-up, configure, use, and administer the Change Data Capture process in your environment.

## Title: Find Performance Problems by Reading the Waits
 
**Abstract**:
Start with a simple proposition: a process is either working or waiting.  You can tune the working part, but are you seeing the whole picture? There are many different resources on which your process could be waiting – a lock, memory, disk, CPU, and much more.  When a process must wait, SQL Server will log it. There are hundreds of different wait types, and they are a gold mine of data for finding and solving performance problems – and proving the changes worked.  After attending this session, you will be able to gather wait stats and use them to zero in on performance issues affecting your databases.  Stop guessing, start knowing!

## Title: Understanding SQL Server XML Features
 
**Abstract**:
The XML Functionality embedded into SQL Server 2005 and 2008 is one of its most powerful yet least understood features.  This seems to be primarily because DBA's shy away from it and developers prefer to work with XML in their code.  In this session we will explore the XML features of SQL Server and how we can bridge these two worlds. Topics covered will include retrieving relational data as XML, storing XML in the database using the XML Datatype, XML indexes, and the XQuery functions included in SQL Server.  We will also look at using XML as stored procedure parameters as a way to pass large amounts of complex data between client and server.
