## Title: Making your Emergency DBA Toolkit
 
**Abstract**:
You’ve just been given a server that is having problems and you need to diagnose it quickly. This session will take you through designing your own toolkit to help you quickly diagnose a wide array of problems. We will walk through scripts that will help you pin point various issues quickly and efficiently. This session will take you through;

What’s on fire? – These scripts will help you diagnose what’s happening right now
Specs – What hardware are you dealing with here (you’ll need to know this to make the appropriate decisions)?
Settings – are the most important settings correct for your workload?
Bottlenecks – We’ll see if there are any areas of the system that are throttling us.
By the end of this session you should have the knowledge of what you need to do in order to start on your own kit. This kit is designed to be your lifeline to fix servers quickly and get them working.

All code we’ll go through is either provided as part of this presentation or are open source/community.

## Title: SQL Server hates you(?)
 
**Abstract**:
Have you had performance tank despite the code working fine in another environment? Maybe heard that some SQL is bad but not why? If so, this is the session for you!
This session will start with a walkthrough of some of the basic settings in SQL Server and how they affect you as a developer. It follows with key tips on what settings to change, why some code will wreak havoc on your performance and how isolation levels matter (and why NOLOCK can be an exceptionally bad idea!) The session is led by a 20-year DBA veteran who decided to try to help developers understand performance issues by seeing things from his perspective.
If you want to explore how default settings kill your performance, investigate why harmless SQL might not be quite so harmless and gain insight into how isolation levels affect function and performance, then this session will provide you with the tools to think outside the box and incorporate database engine knowledge into your developer prowess!

## Title: Embedding PowerApps into a Power BI Dashboard
 
**Abstract**:
PowerApps are a relatively new technology released within the Azure stack.  Its primary focus is to empower technical or non-technical developers to create quick and simple custom apps.  They can be used as standalone apps or embedded within websites/mobile apps.  On the other hand, Power BI is now a mature product and needs little introduction.

What if we could use PowerApps and Power BI together?  Can we embed a PowerApp into a Dashboard and give the end user the ability to write back data to a visual?  Come along to my session to find out.

The 1-hour session includes other technologies such as Azure SQL Database, Common Data Service (CDS) and Flow.  In particular, I will demonstrate how you integrate these technologies with PowerApps and Power BI.  Whilst all levels of expertise are welcome, users require prior knowledge of Power BI Dashboards and PowerApps.

## Title: Azure Data Factory v2 – SSIS Data Flows  Custom Extensibility
 
**Abstract**:
Azure Data Factory version 2 (ADFv2) arrived in Sept17 with a bunch of new concepts and features to support our Azure data integration pipelines. In this session, we’ll update your ADFv1 knowledge and start to understand the true nature of scale out control flows and data flows. What’s the integration runtime? Can we easily lift and shift our beloved SSIS packages into the cloud? How do we embed expressions to achieve dynamic activity executions? Do we still need SSIS with the ADF platform as a service? The answers to all these questions and more in this demo packed session. An awareness of Azure Data Factory v1 is recommended before attending this session.

## Title: DevOps, Dev Data and the GDPR: 5 Solutions
 
**Abstract**:
It’s an age-old problem: developers want prod data for dev and test purposes.

It helps them to write better code and to test it effectively. Self-service access to usable test-data aligns well with DevOps principles that encourage teams to adopt a shift-left mentality to testing.

Unfortunately, in the age of data breaches and the GDPR it’s simply illegal to give developers access to some types of sensitive production data.

So what do you do?

In this session I’ll talk about the GDPR, anonymisation, pseudonymisation and 5 techniques you can use to provide appropriate data that is as “production-like” as possible (within the legal and technical constraints). I’ll demo these techniques both in raw T-SQL and using some of the Microsoft and third party tools that are available to make the task easier.

After this session you’ll be equipped to discuss the problem with your colleagues in an informed manner and you’ll be able to suggest several solutions and their relative pros and cons.

## Title: Modern Data Warehousing - The Lambda Approach to Azure BI
 
**Abstract**:
Technology changes quickly - patterns and approaches less so. As people move towards the cloud, there are clear benefits of adopting a polyglot cloud architecture employing a range of distributed components.

This session will take you through the pattern known as the Lambda architecture, a reference pattern for building data analytics systems that can handle any combination of data velocity, variety and volume. The session will outline the set of tools and integration points that can underpin the approach. Do you design real-time reporting systems? Or crunch petabytes of data? Perhaps you are adopting a cloud architecture and just want to handle anything the future throws at you? This session is for you.

We will follow the movement of data through batch and speed layers via Azure Data Lake Store  Analytics and Streaming Analytics before considering the serving layer with Azure SQL DataWarehouse and downstream reporting tools.

## Title: Deep dive into Adaptive Query Processing
 
**Abstract**:
Until SQL Server 2016, the Query Optimizer and the Execution Engine were strictly separated. The Query Optimizer produces an execution plan that, based on statistics and estimates, should be fast. That execution plan is then faithfully executed by the Execution Engine, even if reality turns out to be different from expectations.

SQL Server 2017 changes this! Three new features now allow execution plans to adapt to reality. Memory Grant Feedback increases or decreases assigned memory based on past experience. The Adaptive Join operator allows the optimizer to create two alternative plans, the best of which will be decided at execution time. And with Interleaved Execution, parts of the plan are even completely recompiled mid-execution, with much better cardinality estimates.

If you are more interested in how all this ACTUALLY works than in shiny marketing slides, come to this session. We will spend the full 60 minutes knee-deep in execution plan internals!

## Title: Maintenance a database project and Continuous Delivery using Microsoft Data Tools in practical terms
 
**Abstract**:
A task seems to be easy. Maintenance a project of a database in the code repository, treat as master-version and do deployment evenly and frequently. Simple? Seemingly. The things become more complex as fast as an amount of objects in database growing. While instead of one database, we have over a dozen. When databases have got the references to each other. And how about dictionary tables? Where to keep them and how to script? Additional issues are coming whilst we would like to control instance-level objects.
All these topics I will explain on the session focused on practical aspects of work with Microsoft Visual Studio Data Tools.

## Title: dbachecks - The PowerShell Module to validate your SQL Estate
 
**Abstract**:
As a SQL DBA you want to know that your SQL Server Estate is compliant with the rules that you have set up. Now there is a simple method to set this up using PowerShell and you can get the results in PowerBi or a report emailed to you on a schedule. Details such as

How long since your last backup?
How long since your last DBCC Check?
Are your Agent Operators Correct?
Is AutoClose, AutoShrink, Auto Update Stats set up correctly?
Is DAC Allowed?
Are your file growth settings correct, what about the number of VLFs?
Is your latency, TCP Port, PS remoting as you expect?
Is Page Verify, Data Purity, Compression correctly set up?

and many more checks (even your own) can be achieved using the dbachecks PowerShell module brought to you by the dbatools team.

Join one of the founders of the module, Rob Sewell MVP. and he will show you how easy it is to use this module and release time for more important things whilst keeping the confidence that your estate is as you would expect it

## Title: Harnessing Database Monitoring in a DevOps pipeline
 
**Abstract**:
Showing how a Database Monitoring tool can be used in conjunction with a DevOps process can help prevent shipping performance problems to production. In this session we will be showing how you can

Use data captured from Database Monitoring tool to validate performance testing

Use a Database Monitoring tool as an input to release gates, to only release when defined performance metrics have been met.

Use VSTS extensions to visualise performance test failures

This allows us to automatically fail releases based on poor performance as captured by a baseline in downstream environments, and surface that information in the release tool so that a release manager can understand why a release in the pipeline was marked as failed. This will typically be things like, high CPU, logical IO, missing indexes, or deadlocks.

## Title: Persistence is Futile - Implementing Delayed Durability in SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
The concurrency model of most Relational Database Systems are defined by the ACID properties but as they aim for ever increasing transactional throughput, those rules are bent, ignored, or even broken.

In this session, we will investigate how SQL Server implements transactional durability in order to understand how Delayed Durability bends the rules to remove transactional bottlenecks and achieve improved throughput. We will take a look at how this can be used to compliment In-Memory OLTP performance, and how it might impact or compromise other things.

Attend this session and you will be assimilated!

## Title: Who's flying the plane? What IT can learn from plane crashes
 
**Abstract**:
Why do some planes with very few issues crash while a plane with no engine power can land safely on the Hudson with no loss of life?

Every company will eventually have a disaster. It's just a matter of size and scope. This talk is a general overview of how to respond to an incident and talks about the roles of management and IT. 

This is not your typical discussion of disasters focusing on how to make a backup plan or enable high availability.

I'll touch upon what we can learn from plane crashes and how those lessons can be applied to the IT environment in general.

## Title: Tune the query, not the plan
 
**Abstract**:
Execution plans are a great resource when trying to tune a query, but often we get hung up on trying to fix what we consider to be 'bad' operators, for example table scans vs clustered index scans; scans vs seeks; sort operations.  In this session we will take a look at some misconceptions, step through what SQL Server is doing and see if we are actually improving the performance when we change the plan to have 'better' operators.

## Title: Azure Functions and Automation: The SQL Agent in the Cloud
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft's Platform as a Service solution,  SQL Azure is a compelling solution for many who don't want to manage their own highly available SQL implementation. SQL Azure however does not replicate all of the services of on-premesis SQL, and one of these missing is the SQL Agent. This session looks at what alternatives exist for running and managing SQL jobs in Azure without SQL agent. In particular we will focus on Azure Automation and Azure Functions. The presentation will include a brief overview of the two services and how they are applicable to SQL workloads, followed by a demo of creating and running a SQL job.

Greg Moore is a graduate of RPI. There, he majored in CompSci, but probably spent as much time hiking, canoeing, caving and rock-climbing as he did studying.
He started working with SQL Server 4.21a in 1995 and has survived numerous upgrades.
He's been a Director and later VP of IT at several startups including PowerOne Media, TownNews and Traffiq and now consults. These days, when he's not busy with playing with SQL Server or spending time with his family, he can often be found underground caving or teaching cave rescue with the NCRC.
While his focus is on the operations side of DBA, his interests include DR, performance and general IT problem solving.
He is the author of: IT Disaster Response: Lessons Learned in the Field.

Steve has been working with SQL server for longer than he likes to admit and developing code for longer still. He works as a BI trouble shooter for a Business Intelligence consultancy. He spends far too much time wrestling with recalcitrant servers, bad pieces of code and cursing developers who think documentation is something that happens to other people. Its the only way he can fund his sons ongoing Lego addiction and its indoor work without too much heavy lifting so its not all bad.
