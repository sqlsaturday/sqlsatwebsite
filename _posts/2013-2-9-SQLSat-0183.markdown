## Title: SQL Server Maintenance Plans
 
**Abstract**:
Most DBA’s know you need to be doing some form of maintenance on your databases: Backups, index rebuilding\reorganization, update statistics, integrity checks, and system cleanup.  SQL Server offers some basic tasks to complete this needed maintenance. The session will cover setting up a maintenance plan including the tasks, schedules, and logging. From there, we will dive deeper into the basic task, find out what is going on behind the scene, and discuss when it is ok to use them and when you should create your own.  At the end of the session you will know how to create a maintenance plan, how to log results and keep a history of success or failures, when you should use what SQL Server has provided and when you should create your own plan.

## Title: Build An Affordable SQL Server 2012 Lab
 
**Abstract**:
Do you have an affordable lab set-up running SQL Server 2012 on Windows 2012 to learn and play with? In the 70-462 Administering Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Databases Training Kit, you will need six (!) machines on their own domain to complete the exercises. Using VMWare Workstation 9 ($250), Todd will show how to set up your lab environment on a ~$500 laptop running Windows 7 64-bit, 8GB of RAM, and an SSD drive using less than 40GB of space for the six virtual machines! Using free iso(s), we will run through several of the set-up exercises from the 70-462 Training Kit in order to build out the training lab. Participants will leave with enough knowledge and links to resources to build their own affordable SQL Server 2012 lab.

## Title: Data Vault Data Warehouse Architecture
 
**Abstract**:
Data vault is a compelling architecture for an enterprise data warehouse using SQL Server 2012.  A well designed data vault data warehouse facilitates fast, efficient and maintainable population of a data mart.  SQL Server 2012 introduces column store indexes and the Vertipaq engine.  Because the Vertipaq engine allows you to use a dimensional model or a relational model, I will argue that a data vault design is the best architecture for your data warehouse.   In this session we will introduce you to the data vault architecture, the new modeling capabilities of Vertipaq, compare the performance of the OLAP engine vs the Tabular engine and discuss data warehouse design options to best leverage column store indexes.

## Title: Virtualizing our Environment
 
**Abstract**:
This session will describe our journey to convert our cluttered, underutilized, power draining physical hosts to a sleek virtualized environment.  This session will also provide some VMware high level architecture, terms and concepts, and a look at vSphere (VMware admin console).  I'll discuss the differences between virtual and physical host metrics and issues surrounding them.  We'll discuss some virtualization shortcomings and then show a little about Confio's Ignite and how it can help DBAs achieve virtualization and not lose visibility of their physical layer.

## Title: SSIS ETL for Type1 and Type2 SCD
 
**Abstract**:
How to handle and track changes in a data warehouse dimension table is an important dimensional modeling consideration.  The dimension tables of a data warehouse need to be designed to appropriately store a history of attribute changes over time.  The ETL processes need to detect these changes and correctly update the dimensional table to preserve historical accuracy.  Finally, fact records need to be associated with the correct historical version of the dimension.  In this presentation, a SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) will be demonstrated that creates an ETL data flow which will load a dimensional table with both Type 1 and Type 2 dimensional attributes.

## Title: Exposing the Core: SQL 2012 on Server Core
 
**Abstract**:
Everything that's old is new again, as Windows Server moves back to the terminal interface.  With SQL 2012, we can now run our SQL Servers on Server Core, a version of the Windows OS that is smaller and more secure.  This presentation will introduce you to Server Core, how to prepare it for a SQL installation(including using Powershell for management), and how to actually install SQL 2012 on to it.

## Title: Using Columnstore Indexes in SQL Server 2012
 
**Abstract**:
Columnstore Indexes in SQL Server 2012 will allow you to significantly improve the speed of data warehousing queries without creating cubes, aggregated tables, or other techniques normally used to improve performance.  This session will show how to implement this new type of index in SQL Server and demonstrate their advantages compared to traditional solutions.  Carlos also discuss the scenarios for which columnstore indexes should be implemented instead of cubes, on top of star schemas, and with reporting tables to provide powerful but flexible BI solutions.

## Title: Outages; Dispatchers, Cops and Detectives
 
**Abstract**:
Recently I watched the news as a crisis situation was played out. There were police officers were running around, moving behind large solid objects like cars, putting on their protective gear.  At first it looked like mass chaos but after watching it closely the officers moved like a well-oiled machine. 
 
The more I watched the more I realized that as database professionals we have crisis situations as well. As the situations are compared there are a number of things that we can learn by watching how other professionals handle crisis.  This session is dedicated to looking at how others handle crisis so that we can learn from what they do.

## Title: Release Management: A Necessary Evil
 
**Abstract**:
The very nature of a database system is to be dynamic; rarely static. The applications that use databases tend to change, requiring changes to occur within our databases.  The totality of pieces and parts that comprise this ‘change’ will be combined into a ‘Release’ that will be applied to your systems. Controlling this change is not rocket science, but it is not without its complexities. We will discuss various terms, processes, ideas, and suggest tools to assist you in performing this necessary function, while minimizing risk, and impacting your systems in a graceful fashion.
