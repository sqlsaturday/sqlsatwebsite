## Title: Investigate, analyze and solve common wait stats scenarios
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server is a high frequently used piece of software which need to serve single requests and/or hundreds of thousands of requests in a minute. Within these different kinds of workloads Microsoft SQL Server has to handle the concurrency of tasks in a fashion manner. This demo driven session shows different scenarios where Microsoft SQL Server has to wait and manage hundreds of tasks. See, analyze and solve different wait stats due to their performance impact:
- CXPACKET: when a query goes parallel
- ASYNC_IO_COMPLETION: speed up IO operations (Growth / Backup / Restore)
- ASYNC_NETWORK_IO: What happens if your application refuses data?
- THREADPOOL starvation: crush of requests for Microsoft SQL Server
- PAGELATCH_xx: How does Microsoft SQL Server protects data?

## Title: SQL Server Reporting Services 2017 on Steroids!!
 
**Abstract**:
Reporting requests that are required ‘yesterday or sooner’, oft times necessitate working more efficiently and effectively. We have all been through this at one time or another.
In this hands on presentation we shall be looking some of the more challenging techniques of extracting our data from our Multidimensional and Tabular Models, in addition to our Data Mining Models. 
We shall be utilizing concepts of  ‘Openquery()’ and ‘linked servers’ as a means to extract data,  in addition to looking at the way that these two concepts can help us extract our data utilizing MDX, DMX and DAX expressions;  AND YET maintain the  flexibility and the ability to utilize all those wonderful techniques that may  be done with T-SQL.

## Title: Daily indexing problems and its - possible - solution
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever been in the situation that an application performed well the last day and - suddenly - you run into problems? Although you have Index Maintenance jobs and statistics up to date you will monitor a big degrade of performance! This session will demonstrate in a over 80 percent demo based presentation the following scenarios which happend this way in real life!
- Why performance degradation in spite of maintenance jobs?
- just one more database in the result set and the query runs really bad - why?
- usage of literals is completely different from the usage of variables - why?
- identical data types but the query runs in part perfect and in part bad...
- your execution plan shows an INDEX SEEK - but the table will be scanned!
- you get a query from the business which performs really bad but when you test it it runs pretty cool - why?

## Title: DevOps 101 for Data People
 
**Abstract**:
In 2009 John Allspaw and Paul Hammond delivered the session "10 deploys per day - Dev  ops cooperation at Flickr." In forty six minutes they changed the way millions of people would think about the software delivery process for years to come. It didn't have a name yet, but DevOps was born. DevOps folk preached about the cloud, automation, rapid delivery and any database technology that wasn't relational.
 
In 2013 Kenny Gorman declared "The DBA is Dead".
 
For the record, I don't believe that, but a lot of people do. What is certain is that the world of IT is changing and traditional roles are changing with it. We all need to adapt.
 
In this interactive talk I'll explain what DevOps is, where it came from, and its implications for SQL Server. I'll demo example solutions to some of the foundational technical challenges (source control and test/deployment automation) and will leave plenty of time at the end to answer your questions.

## Title: Wading into Stream Analytics
 
**Abstract**:
Large volumes of data originate at high velocity from various sources including IoT devices and sensors, web sites and social media feeds. A common approach is to simply store these data for offline processing.

Processing that in many instances never happens...

Wouldn't it be more efficient and effective to process the data stream as it arrives?

Azure Stream Analytics is an event-processing engine which enables processing of streaming data in real time. It can handle up to 1 Gb of data per second, which should suffice for most applications.

In this tutorial I'll take you through the processing of setting up a job on Azure Stream Analytics. I'll look specifically at the following:

- connecting to a data source
- extracting information
- identifying patterns and relationships
- using machine learning
- triggering actions
- reporting tools and
- offline processing.

To illustrate these concepts we'll build a real time sentiment analysis system for streaming data from Twitter.

## Title: DevOps, Dev Data and Data Breaches: 5 Solutions
 
**Abstract**:
It’s an age-old problem: developers want prod data for dev and test purposes.

It helps them to write better code and to test it effectively. Self-service access to usable test-data aligns well with DevOps principles that encourage teams to adopt a shift-left mentality to testing.

Unfortunately, in the age of data breaches and tighter regulation it's unwise to give developers access to some types of sensitive production data.

So what do you do?

In this session I’ll talk about the GDPR, anonymisation, pseudonymisation and 5 techniques you can use to provide appropriate data that is as “production-like” as possible (within the legal and technical constraints). I’ll demo these techniques both in raw T-SQL and using some of the Microsoft and third party tools that are available to make the task easier.

After this session you’ll be equipped to discuss the problem with your colleagues in an informed manner and you’ll be able to suggest several solutions and their relative pros and cons.

## Title: Power BI data preparation with Dataflows
 
**Abstract**:
Data preparation is often the most labour-intensive component of an analytics project and getting this right is vital if the results are to be accurate. While the growth of self-service BI has empowered users to answer important questions, ensuring well managed data is available to all employees remains one of businesses biggest challenges. 
Dataflows is an extension of the Power BI ecosystem, providing a low code approach using Power Query to create curated datasets that can be easily consumed by business analysts, thereby improving the speed at which business value can be delivered. Dataflows provides a single-version-of-the-truth which was traditionally attained by building a data warehouse. 
You will learn
-How Dataflows can be used to create rich, vetted datasets
-How Dataflows can be created with the click of a button, ingesting data from many well knows SAAS solution such as Dynamics and Salesforce
-How to manage Dataflows using advanced data preparation tools such as Databricks

## Title: Castles in the Sky: Achieving A secure Cloud infrastructure
 
**Abstract**:
A significant issue for enterprises moving to private or public clouds is how to trust the infrastructure and providers with their sensitive workloads. Customers need the ability to assess security standards, trust security implementations, and prove infrastructure compliance to auditors.
This session will highlight the issues with cloud architectures and discuss ways to achieve visibility, compliance, and security. We will examine solution stacks that enable trusted computing and illustrate several usages that demonstrate policy enforcement, compliance, and end-to-end trust in the cloud. 
The session will also examine how organizations can monitor and enforce geolocation restrictions, ensuring that their workloads in the cloud are deployed on trusted hardware in known locations to meet security policy compliance. Trusted geolocation allows organizations to establish security and physical boundaries that limit which systems process and store sensitive information and applications in th

## Title: Python integration in Power BI
 
**Abstract**:
The August release of Power BI Desktop features a preview of Python integration. Python script is now available in the Query Editor, and a new Py visual supports Python script. Come and learn how to get started with Python in Power BI. Lots of demos in this session that cover some basic, yet useful patterns.  

Between demos we will chat a bit about the importance of Python integration and why it is a significant step for Power BI. Python is widely used and runs across platforms and applications. Any investment you have made in learning Python (or are planning to make), means that you are on the road to build skills considered to be the universal data science and utility language ... often referred to as the Swiss army knife of programming. 

When you wrap your Python script in the best business analytics tool on the market (no prizes for guessing its Power BI ... and yes I am biased), you are well on your way to become a "Power Py" guru!
