## Title: A Systematic Approach to ETL Performance Tuning
 
**Abstract**:
ETL performance tuning can be an especially challenging task, largely because of the number of moving parts in the process. From extracting the information from the source system, to staging in SQL Server and transforming into the relational data warehouse, to processing new information into the cube, there are so many things that can contribute to exceeding the specified batch window.

In this session, we’ll look at the high-level system as a whole and discuss possible areas contributing to a lag in performance. We’ll also talk about implementing instrumentation components to monitor all aspects of the ETL solution, using SSIS 2012's Catalog. We’ll use this monitoring data and an example case study to walk through the process of tuning the ETL system to make sure the data warehouse is consistently available at the required time.

## Title: Table Partitioning: the Secret Weapon for your Big Data Problems.
 
**Abstract**:
Is big data starting to slow you down? Is data growth putting your maintenance tasks in danger of not meeting your service level agreements? Do you wish you could archive old data with minimal impact to your tables during the archive process? Do you wish you could eliminate the majority of the data in your tables when you query them? If so, its time you consider implementing table partitioning to help with your general performance and to reduce your maintenance window for completing your maintenance tasks. In this session you will learn how table partitioning works and when it should be implemented. You will be able to understand how to initially configure partition functions and partition schemes to have a rock solid partitioned table. Finally, you will learn how to implement an automated sliding window to maintain your partitioned tables for ensuring optimal performance.

## Title: Wish you could live the glamorous consulting life?
 
**Abstract**:
Consulting is a great career choice, from the increased pay, (sometimes less), to the flexible hours, (working nights and weekends), you will work with a wide range of customers, (if you can find them), that will lead you to wonder why you didn't start earlier? (and walk away from a cushy job).

I would not trade my consulting career for any other choice, I love the rewards and the freedom it provides me, but I've learned the hard way.
In this session you will lean sales, marketing and management strategies to get your practice off the ground, sand traps to avoid along the way and a honest, down to earth assessment of the consulting life. An essential session for those thinking about this choice and/or those who are just starting out

## Title: Leveraging Flash Technologies for Increased SQL Server Performance
 
**Abstract**:
Over the past few decades we have witnessed a chronic and widening imbalance among processor bandwidth, disk capacity, and access speed of disk.  There has been an exponential increase in performance for CPU and network over the last several years, yet the speed of traditional drives has not kept pace.  This suggests that the performance of an OLTP system would be seriously limited without a considerable improvement in I/O throughput.  Since the market debut of flash memory SSD a few years ago, storage vendors have made a continued effort to overcome SSD’s poor random write performance and to provide stable and sufficient I/O throughput.  Today we now have an extensive array (pun intended) of flash solutions that can provide real benefits to SQL Server deployments.  In this session you will learn:
•	The evolution of disk and Flash storage
•	The Physics behind Flash
•	The Different types of Flash (Server, Hybrid and Storage)
•	How to leverage Flash to get the most out of SQL Server

## Title: Tips and Tricks for architecting a BI infrastructure on SQL 2012 Power View
 
**Abstract**:
Analytics is changing the surface of the industry, the speed of how we sell, look at data, analyze information. Users want to see traffic data meshed with order data, supply and inventory data, and then add up financial and geographical data. Simply put it, it is a huge explosion of data, where BigData is key. 
They need to analyze customer behavior, then take this information and tie in with customer 360 view, straight from Sales force to do demand generation. 
In this session you will see tips and tricks for setting up an enterprise infrastructure based on SQL Server 2012 Business Intelligence analytical tools Power View and PowerPivot that includes SharePoint 2013, SQL Server Engine 2012, SSIS 2012, Analysis Services Multidimensional, Tabular, and PowerPivot modes as well as SQL Reporting Services, PowerPivot and Power View.

## Title: Real-Time Analytics with Power View and SSAS Tabular in DirectQuery Mode
 
**Abstract**:

In DirectQuery mode the data is guaranteed to be up-to-date, no refreshing or processing is necessary, because DirectQuery mode queries data stored in a SQL Server database. We will provide concepts and step-by-step examples of setting up a BI Semantic Model, including security, best practices for getting the most out of Power View and the differences between DirectQuery and the In-Memory VertiPaq cache, so you are equipped to start building real-time analytics solutions with SSAS and Power View.

## Title: Extreme Design – A Real World 10+ Exabyte Data Warehouse
 
**Abstract**:
A large number of people, including many at Microsoft have bought into the marketing BS called “Big Data”.  When you hear “big data”, everyone automatically assumes that you have to do this in some other database platform being foisted on IT.  Microsoft starts a sentence with “big data” and finishes the sentence with Hadoop.  The implication all over the industry and from Microsoft itself is that SQL Server can’t handle “big data”.  This session will walk you through the architecture and build out of a real world data warehouse, spanning over 600,000 SQL Servers, which is currently in excess of 10 Exabytes.  We melted a set of Hadoop clusters before they even came close to what SQL Server was serving.

## Title: Tell Better Stories with Microsoft BI and PowerMap
 
**Abstract**:
Storytelling seems to be a lost art form; in this fast-paced world people are more interested in getting as many bits of information as they can. But without a story, something to pull all the data together, the target audience will probably gloss over your message. Throwing a few numbers and charts at the reader has become pretty acceptable nowadays. But to make something truly memorable, and hopefully shared with someone else, you need some kind of story. You need something to tie it all together, to give it some meaning. That’s where Microsoft steps in with its latest addition to the Business Intelligence Analytics space with an add-in to Excel called PowerMap.

**Abstract**:
XML is all over the place.  But how do you get that data into SQL Server?  SSIS provides an XML Source, but it is not easy to use.  In this session we will handle increasingly complex XML documents.  After an introduction to using the XML Source with a single set of elements, we will look at how to work with multiple element sets.  This includes hierarchically structured XML documents.

Attendees will be able to import simple XML using SSIS.  They will be able to create import routines that pull data from different elements of more complex XML.  They will understand the role the XML Schema plays in defining the XML data they import.

## Title: SQL Security Best Practices  Shrinking Your Attack Surface
 
**Abstract**:
Every industry has a governing body or standard that requires some layer of security to your data.  In my travels I have come to realize that when someone mentions security, DBA's tend to get frightened.  This could be due to a lack of understanding of the requirements or not knowing what SQL Server offers to meet those requirements.  In this session we will go over what SQL Server has to offer, Security Best Practices and how you can shrink your attack surface to meet Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of your Servers and Data.
In addition, attending this talk is worth 1.5 Continuing Education credits.
