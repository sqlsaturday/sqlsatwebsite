## Title: Hardware 201: Selecting Database Hardware
 
**Abstract**:
The foundation of database performance is the underlying server hardware and storage subsystem. Even the best designed and optimized database application can be crippled by an inadequate hardware and storage infrastructure. Recent advances in new processors and chipsets, along with improvements in magnetic and SSD storage have dramatically changed the evaluation and selection process compared to the past. Many database professionals struggle to keep up with new technology and often simply let someone else make their hardware selection and sizing decisions. Don't let this happen to you! This session covers current and upcoming hardware from both Intel and AMD.

## Title: Beyond Plateaux: Optimize SSAS via Best Practices
 
**Abstract**:
Whether we inherit our Analysis Services environments from predecessors or create them - learning as we go - ourselves, we often conclude that performance (processing and / or querying) and functionality can be enhanced.  In this session, Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson overviews ways to launch new capabilities and to propel performance beyond its current plateau, using design best practices to better meet consumer performance and functional needs.

## Title: Tips and Tricks for Auditing in SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2005 and later continued to introduce tools to help you audit what was occurring in your database, with 2012 introducing even more auditing tools.  In this session, we'll go over the questions you need to ask your business to determine what level of auditing is appropriate.  We'll go through how to set up many of the common audits to meet your business' requirements.   Each technique has its features and each has associated costs - your goal is to find a balance.

**Brandie Tarvin**
 
Database Administrator by day and Author by night Brandie Tarvin sails pirate-populated waters, fights evil robots in disguise and turns kingdoms into chaotic rebellious city-states all while coding ETL processes and protecting real-world data from corruption. If it weren't for her, someone else would have the job and where would be the fun in that?

Brandie's first computer experience was with a State-of-the-Art Commodore 64 brought home by her father, who informed her that "computers are NOT toys" and would not let her use it until she learned how to program. In late 2003, she turned her hobbies of programming, MUSHing and assisting friends with generic tech support into a full time career as a database administrator. She's been stuck in the fabulous and bizarre world of professional IT work ever since.

Currently, Brandie is a Database Administrator  Developer for Allstate Dealer Services in Jacksonville. She has published several articles on SQLServerCentral.com, trains her co-workers in SQL Server, and has previously presented at several SQLSaturday events and JSSUG meetings. She also writes fiction and freelances for Catalyst Game Labs in her spare time.
