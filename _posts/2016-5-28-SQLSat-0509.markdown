## Title: Temporal Databases in Microsoft SQL server 2016
 
**Abstract**:
Introducing Temporal Databases in SQL Server 2016

More and more organizations are storing archives of data to help them make important business decisions. Traditionally, organizations had to rely on expensive, and tedious methods to go back in time and make sense of growth, negative growth, profit, loss, etc.

Microsoft SQL Server 2016 introduces a new feature called Temporal Databases which essentially solves all the problems mentioned above.

This presentation aims to go deep into Temporal Databases (requirements, use cases, technical know-hows) and present some demo’s in order to gain specific understanding on this new feature which is being called “Time Travel”.

## Title: Moving from Profiler to Extended Events.
 
**Abstract**:
Profiler has been with us for a long time and it's pretty much the goto tool for a lot of performance related issues but there's been a new tool around for a few years now - actually since SQL SERVER 2008 - but there doesn't seem to have been a big uptake of it. Well, after this session hopefully that will all change for you.
Profiler is now deprecated and all new work is going into extended events. This means that new monitoring events are constantly being added. These give deeper insights into performance problems withing SQL SERVER and also aid the developer / DBA in understanding the inner working of the SQL SERVER database engine.
An understanding of profiler would be advantageous but is definitely not required to get some good insights from this session.

## Title: TempDB: The forgotten pillar of performance tuning
 
**Abstract**:
TempDB is an integral part of SQL Server, and is often overlooked when trying to get the most out of your system. Researching the many suggested methods of tuning TempDB is a long, arduous and at times confusing process.

In this session we will go over what TempDB is used for, why it is a special and important type of database and how to tune it to enhance the performance of your overall system. 

We will start with determining the best configuration of TempDB database files to use, the impact disk configuration has, which trace flags are important and what changes SQL Server 2016 will bring us. We will look at what is stored in TempDB and how both developers and DBA can optimize how TempDB is configured and used.

We will then use these best practices to optimize our instance and performance tune our queries to make the system faster.

## Title: Boost your SQL Server performance with Delayed Durability and BPE
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2014 has come with many performance boosting features. In-Memory OLTP being one of the favourites, there are two more less talked about heroes - Delayed Durability and Buffer Pool Extensions. With the increase of usage of SSDs in production environment it has become essential to use them to the full potential. In this session Manohar will explore Delayed Durability and how it is achieved. He will also cover a case study with delayed durability and SSDs. SSDs can be fully utilized by enabling Buffer Pool Extensions. He will cover the usage and caveats of both these features which boosts the transaction throughput.

## Title: Azure Machine Learning: From Design to Integration
 
**Abstract**:
Machine Learning is a subfield of computer science concerned with systems that learn from data. So this isn’t about systems that follow explicitly programmed instructions, but rather about systems that find patterns and trends within datasets, and use them to deliver insight and predictions.

In this session, you will learn how an Azure Machine Learning solution comes to life: From the creation of a workspace, to the preparation of data, to experimentation with Machine Learning algorithms, and then finally to the integration and embedding of predictive insights into applications.

This session has been specifically designed to describe Machine Learning fundamentals, and to help enable and inspire existing data professionals taking their first steps to leverage cloud-based predictive models delivered with Azure Machine Learning. It is guaranteed to thrill you with potential, and excite you with the relative ease by which it can be accomplished.

## Title: SQL Server 2016 -  Real Time Operational Analytics - "Real" Game changer
 
**Abstract**:
Performing analytics on operational data has all along being a huge challenge for applications, due to its impact on
regular operations and day to day transactions. SQL Server 2016 has extended its analytic capablities by its
enahancements on "In memory tables" and Columnstore indexes."In memory tables" combined with columnstore indexes
is a boon for performing analytics on operational data with no impact to regular workload, with no delayed data,
no complex ETL tasks and without a need to maintain seperate data warehouse. 

The presentation would cover how "In Memory" Columnstore indexes help to perform real time operational analytics 
and would involve interesting demos show casing the gains using SQL Server 2016 "In Memory" and Column Store Index enhancements. Presentation would also demonstrate and compare the performances of "In Memory" columnstore indexes and disk based columnstore indexes.

## Title: Automated Data Validation with SQL Server using nUnit
 
**Abstract**:
Testing software is hard work. Testing BI solutions is even harder;there's lots of moving parts, the tools are thin and it takes a lot of time and effort. Software development uses unit testing and while this can be applied to the different parts of a BI solution, most people are more interested in the numbers the solution produces and proving that they are right. So can you validate the numbers in your BI solution? And can you do it quickly and easily? In this session we will cover an approach for automating the validation of your BI solution covering multiple scenarios with a hand full of demos. We will be using nUnit as a framework and some free codeplex tools, so we can run a suite of tests every time we load data into our BI platform. This is not continuous integration, and it is not unit testing in the true sense either. It is, instead, "continuous validation", and it can provide you with an awful lot of assurance for not very much extra effort.

## Title: Automated and Repeatable Test Cases for SQL Server Development.
 
**Abstract**:
Automated and repeatable test cases are required for agile software development.  In this session we will look at some of the tools and techniques for automated testing with SQL Server.  Demonstrations during the session will create tests using the Visual Studio toolset and discuss how they can be used for Test Driven Development (TDD), unit testing, integration testing and acceptance testing.  The presentation will cover testing SQL Server Databases, SQL Server Analysis Services and SQL Server Integration Services.  Following the session attendees will be able to incorporate these tools and practices into their projects.

## Title: Hitting the SQL Server "Go Faster" Button
 
**Abstract**:
Tuning individual queries is incredibly resource intensive.  Everyone wants a "Go Faster" button that will improve performance across the entire SQL instance.  While there is no sp_gofaster command to run, there are a bunch of magic knobs and switches that can quite often achieve the desired results.
  In this session we'll look at some of the things you can do to get the best performance out of your SQL Server workload.  You'll leave with a shopping list of things to check and options to try in your environments to get the performance you are after.

## Title: Query Store Overview and Architecture
 
**Abstract**:
Fixing performance problems and detecting query regressions has never been easy in SQL Server as the database engine fundamentally does not capture the relevant information.
With the release of SQL Server 2016, Microsoft has introduced a feature called Query Store that will help you capture vital query metrics that will help performance troubleshooting and regression detection.
In this session we will examine Query Store, examine it's architecture, configuration and how it can be used to solve real-world performance problems.
