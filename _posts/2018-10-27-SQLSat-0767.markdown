## Title: Reducing The Surface Area Of Risk in Data Security
 
**Abstract**:
Data obfuscation, also known as data masking, is soon a legal requirement. Data masking is the best way to secure non-production systems (i.e. DEV, TEST, etc) to greatly reduce the surface area of risk for data breach in your organization.  Masking isn't encryption, which is an appropriate solution for production applications.  Masking also isn't just a SQL Server feature, it is a technique common across databases.

Data masking for data at-rest removes the value from the asset.  This reduces your organizations "surface area of risk" overall, permitting your organization to prioritize security efforts where they are absolutely needed.  There are other possible solutions, such as synthesizing data and redaction, which present other challenges.

Come learn about the right way to secure non-production data to limit exposure only to production.  Learn what techniques can be used, why, and what factors should be considered when deciding to secure confidential data.

## Title: Using Kafka for Real-Time Data Ingestion with .NET
 
**Abstract**:
Remember that first time you saw Service Broker and thought of all the great things you could do with it? Remember when you actually tried Service Broker and found all the limitations and pain points? Enter Apache Kafka. Apache Kafka is a distributed publish-subscribe messaging system which can scale out to handle millions of messages per second and support a distributed, microservices-oriented architecture. In this talk, we will cover the basics of this powerful system, including general architectural and design principles. We will also build a .NET project which uses Kafka to produce and consume messages quickly and efficiently.

## Title: Getting Started with Extended Events
 
**Abstract**:
Few subjects in Microsoft SQL Server inspire the same amount of Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) as Extended Events.  Many DBA's continue to use Profiler and SQL Trace even though they have been deprecated for years.  Why is this?

Extended Events started out in SQL Server 2008 with no user interface and only a few voices in the community documenting the features as they found them.  Since then it has blossomed into a full feature of SQL Server and an amazingly low-impact replacement for Profiler and Trace.

Come learn how to get started - the basics of sessions, events, actions, targets, packages, and more.  We will look at some base scenarios where Extended Events can be very useful as well as considering a few gotchas along the way.  You may never go back to Profiler again!

## Title: Taking the pain out of database migrations
 
**Abstract**:
Database migrations are scary. The migration of a database has many moving pieces and things to think about. Some of those things have nothing to do with the DBA and are outside of their control. However, if these items are not taken into account, it is the DBA that management will hold responsible for the failure. 

This session will discuss what you need to take into account to ensure a successful pain free database migration. These steps can be used for a single database, multiple databases, or an entire server. By the end of the session, you will have a checklist of the items you need to consider for a database migration.

## Title: Zen and the Art of Baselines
 
**Abstract**:
If your boss asked you for the list of the five most CPU-hungry databases in your environment six months from now for an upcoming licensing review, could you come up with an answer? Performance data can be overwhelming, but this session can help you make sense of the mess. Twisting your brain and looking at the data in different ways can help you identify resource bottlenecks that are limiting your SQL Server performance today. Painting a clear picture of what your servers should be doing can help alert you when something is abnormal. Trending this data over time will help you project how much resource consumption you will have months away. Come learn how to extract meaning from your performance trends and how to use it to proactively manage the resource consumption from your SQL Servers.

## Title: Monster Text Manipulation: Regular Expressions for the DBA
 
**Abstract**:
Regular expressions can help you perform incredible tasks with very little effort. Need to create 1700 logins from an email request? Developers give you a single script with 300 stored procedures filled with table variables instead of temp tables? Need to move 500 databases to a different drive? Any of these tasks can take a long time to code, but regular expressions cuts that work from hours to seconds. I use regular expressions all the time and I have taken many tasks down from several days to just a few minutes. Stop writing code manually and let regular expressions do it for you. 
Here you’ll learn: 
• The most useful regular expression commands. 
• The appropriate times to use regular expressions. 
• How to use regular expressions to write code for you. 
• How to incorporate regular expressions into large tasks and combine them with other methods.

## Title: Beginning Admin: The Care and Feeding of SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Design and development may be exciting, but database administration is absolutely critical (and, reasonably well-paying!) The care and feeding of a server tends to get short-changed or neglected.  In this class, we'll cover the basics of the big five administrator tasks:

* Backups – You must set up regular backups, to keep copies of your databases...just in case something breaks, or someone makes a bad, bad mistake.
* Integrity checks – Regularly and automatically check databases for corruption, which is when bits get scrambled, lost, and ruined.
* Index maintenance – Databases need regular upkeep so they'll continue to run well.
* Disk management – It's actually your job to find out about full disks before they happen. After all, databases grow!
* Alerting – Alerts tell you what's wrong, so you don't have to go looking for problems.

Being a database administrator is a big job, but we can cover the basics in one session!

## Title: Why should I care about ... the plan cache?
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this installment of Rick's "Why should I care" series, he lays out a case for why working knowledge of the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments. A review of relevant views and functions is included for the (newly?) motivated audience.

Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why their DBAs often seem so frazzled. This is not a deep dive into the cache, it really is primarily a session exploring _why_ these DMOs are worth slogging through.

## Title: How to Keep Your Databases Secure in Just Minutes a Day
 
**Abstract**:
You’re busy. You don’t have time to check the security of your systems all the time, right? It’s not like anyone has added a user that you don’t know about. And no one would create a database and add all logins to the db_owner role. And of course, no one would ever think of setting the TRUSTWORTHY property on a database... right?

Things like that happen on a daily basis, poking holes in even the most well-secured database. Those holes are just waiting for someone to find them. That someone could be you, or it could be an attacker probing for a way to get data from your company.

In this session, we will explore how to create reports that are quick to review so you can find the holes before someone else does - without interfering with the rest of your day. Along the way, you'll also learn where to find security-related information in SQL Server's metadata and logs to allow you to customize and extend the reports to meet your company's unique needs.

## Title: T-SQL's Hidden Support Feature
 
**Abstract**:
The most effective T-SQL support feature comes installed with every edition of SQL Server, is enabled by default, and costs no overhead. Yet, the vast majority of database administrator underutilize or completely neglect it. That feature's name is "comments".

In this session, Microsoft Certified Master Jennifer McCown will demonstrate the various commenting methods that make code supportable. Attendees will#160;learn what’s important in a header comment, use code blocking to edit code, build a comprehensive help system, and explore alternative comment methods in stored procedures, SSIS packages, SSRS reports, and beyond. These methods help prevent errors and reduce troubleshooting.

## Title: Processing Analysis Services Tabular Models
 
**Abstract**:
For large in-memory Analysis Services Tabular models, the design of table partitions and the scheduled refresh/processing operations has significant implications for query performance, resource utilization, processing duration, and database availability. This session will review the tabular model's processing operation types, design decisions such as parallelism and transactions, and provide examples of Tabular Model Scripting Language (TMSL) scripts and PowerShell scripts used to support the processing of Tabular models. Additionally, common Azure and on-premises job automation and orchestration tools used in the processing of Tabular models will be demonstrated including Azure Automation, SQL Server Agent, and SSIS.

## Title: Analysis Services is in Azure? Seriously!? Let's build a model!
 
**Abstract**:
Have you used SSAS before? Have you created reports using T-SQL and Group by? Are you interested in or currently using Power BI? Do you you have a need for Analysis  Services but don't want to have to deal with the hassle of buying and installing a server? Are you dreading having to upgrade your hardware for your current SSAS Tabular instance?  Is your organization using Office 365?  If you answered yes to any of these questions, you might need Azure Analysis Services.  The wait is over! Azure Analysis Services is the platform as a service version of the wildly popular Analysis Services Tabular product. 

This demo heavy session will be focused on setting up Azure Analysis Services, deploying a model, loading the model with data and finally reporting from your Azure Analysis Services instance.

## Title: Temporal Tables – The New Hotness in Data Auditing
 
**Abstract**:
A common issue database administrators face is data auditing.  Many use triggers, CDC, third-party tools, or roll their own type of auditing tool.  In SQL Server 2016, a new feature called Temporal Tables was introduced and helps to simplify this common need.  In this session, we will take a look at what temporal tables are, how they work and how you can implement them into your environment.

## Title: Understanding SQL Server Always Encrypted
 
**Abstract**:
Always Encrypted is a highly-touted feature of SQL Server that promises to make encryption simple to use and transparent to applications while still protecting the data both at rest and in motion, even from high-privilege users such as developers and DBAs.  Does that sound too good to be true?  It isn’t - Always Encrypted is an incredible feature - but like any new technology, it does have some limitations.  In this session, you’ll see how to configure Always Encrypted, and we’ll talk about when you should and shouldn’t use it in your environment.

## Title: Level Up Your Cloud Skills
 
**Abstract**:
Think infrastructure in the cloud is still just for sysadmins? Think again! As your organization moves into the cloud, infrastructure architecture skills are more important than ever for DBAs to master. Expert knowledge of cloud-related infrastructure will help you maintain performance and availability for databases in the cloud. For example, know what an IOP is? Should you use a database-as-a-service or provision a cloud-based VM? How many compute resources does your database consume during a given day? Can you secure it properly? Come learn many of the key cloud infrastructure points that you should master as the DBA role continues to evolve!

## Title: APPLY Yourself
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft introduced the APPLY operator in SQL Server 2005. This under-used, non-standard operator can help us solve a number of common (and not-so-common) problems with elegant code which performs well. We will look several problem spaces in which the APPLY operator shines, such as joining to table-valued functions, getting the top N child records for each parent record, string splitting, and word matching. With the use of these examples, we will gain a deeper understanding of when to use the APPLY operator.
