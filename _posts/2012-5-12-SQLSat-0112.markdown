## Title: Introduction to FileTables
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2012 introduces the first significant enhancement to FILESTREAM: FileTables. FileTables use the underlying FILESTREAM storage, but expose the stored data using traditional Windows file I/O APIs. In addition, they also support hierarchical data storage (read "folders"). This session will show how to set up your SQL Server instance to support FileTables, how to create a FileTable and how to access it using standard Windows file APIs.
It may be valuable to attend the Introduction to FILESTREAM session also.

## Title: Best Practices for Monitoring Databases on VMware
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server on VMware???  Many of our customers are either virtualizing databases or planning to do so soon. I hear from many groups that attempted running their database on VMware but went back to physical hardware because of performance issues. There are many reasons this may have happened, but quite often the decision to go back to physical was not based on hard facts. This presentation will explore the fundamentals of monitoring databases running in a VMware environment. If you are using classic O/S monitoring tools, you may be getting misleading data. Understand what metrics are important and how to get to that data.

## Title: Become a PowerShell Pop Star
 
**Abstract**:
So you've heard about this cool scripting language from Microsoft called PowerShell. Maybe you've even thought "I need to learn something about that."

We'll start with the basics, cmdlets, variables, and providers. Then we'll look a quick look programming fundamentals, such as as branching, looping, script blocks and variable scoping. Finally we'll get into the advanced, fun stuff like functions, error handling, working with file types and wrap it up with creating a spiffy user interface. They'll be rolling out the red carpet when you get back to work Monday for the newest PowerShell Pop Star.

## Title: What Sequence objects are (and are not)
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2012 adds a new object to our arsenal called a sequence that can will give us the capability to implement automatically incrementing values. However, it cannot replace a lot of functionality that we have used a numbers table and windowing functions for (though they can be complimentary to one another). In this session I will demonstrate the uses and performance characteristics of sequences, including how they compliment the use of number tables and windowing functions to create surrogate key and sorting values, and more.
