## Title: Accelerating SQL with Solid State (w/ iPod Raffle)
 
**Abstract**:
Solid-state technologies are changing the way that MS SQL users run their databases. DBA’s are achieving significant TCO savings through performance enhancements, reliability improvements, and reduced energy and real estate costs using solid-state technologies.  Solid state is changing the way datacenters look and how MS SQL Servers perform. This session will address: 1) On overview of solid state technology options for SQL Server 2) Why solid state makes a difference? 3) An comparison of the different types of NAND Flash-based products and the advantages and disadvantages of each: a. Disk-based SSDs b. Onboard/Embedded PCI Express devices c. Host-based PCI Express devices 4) Customer proof: Wine.com case study 5)Raffle for a Steve Wozniak

## Title: Replication Performance Tuning and Troubleshooting
 
**Abstract**:
This session is for users who want to improve their throughput using Replication Profiles and Server/Networking tweaks. I will also cover custom monitoring stored procedures that don't require you to keep replication monitor on all the time. Last item covered are some queries you can use to see replication errors and common solutions to them. It is expected that you know how to setup replication.

## Title: SSIS for the faint of heart
 
**Abstract**:
Scott's gentle introduction to SQL Server Integration Services (or SSSIS) will primarily be demonstrating how to you can use the tool in the real world to get work done. READ: very little PowerPoint time. SSIS is a high performance ETL solutions introduced in SQL Server 2005 to replace SQL Server's DTS functionality. ETL? It's okay, Scott will briefly cover some of these concepts too. Relax, sit back and learn how to simplify your "Extract, Transform, and Load" processes.

## Title: Auditing your SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
New in SQL Server 2008 Enterprise Edition is a feature called SQL Audit.  This feature allows you to record statements executed against the SQL Server at the server and database scopes, for database, schema and object classes.  Unlike prior features that could be used for capturing these statements, SQL Audit allows the user, greater granularity in statements captured, multiple output targets, and the ability to capture statements previously un-captureable. In this presentation, code will be presented to setup and monitor SQL Audits along with tips and additional code to enhance your SQL Server auditing experience.

## Title: High Volume Real Time Contiguous ETL and Audit
 
**Abstract**:
High volume contiguous ETL is always problematic, and even more so when near-real-time is desired.
This presentation goes through a solution collects and aggregates security audit data for nearly 400000 machines, a contiguous 24x7 stream of nearly 200 events per second, using a budget tight solution that involves SQL Express, Service Broker and Database Mirroring.

## Title: Explicit Transaction Management
 
**Abstract**:
Learn the basics and a few tricks to help your more advanced SQL transactions make sense. Concepts from chapter nine of Beginning SQL Joes 2 Pros are explained by author Rick Morelan. Isolation levels and table hints can be narrowed down to a few easy rules around just two questions.  1) What should SQL check before it allows data changes? 2) What should SQL show when someone else is making changes?

## Title: Using SQL Trace/Profiler Effectively
 
**Abstract**:
The session will cover the difference between SQL Trace and SQL Profiler, and why we recommend using SQL Trace in a production environment. Topics covered will be how and when to use SQL Profiler vs SQL Trace, how to create a trace template and convert it to a SQL script, and how to start a SQL Trace running in response to a performance event. Demos will include creating a trace template and converting it to a script and an example of how SQL Profiler can bring your whole server to a crawl.

**Abstract**:
This session will focus on Microsoft and partner technologies that enable high performance, efficient and real-time data integration using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), and that work with data from Oracle, Teradata, and other heterogeneous sources. You will learn how Microsoft high-speed Connectors by Attunity can be leveraged with change-data-capture (CDC) technologies integrated with SSIS to enable data replication. Use cases highlighting real-time data warehousing and operational reporting, as well as maintenance of data consistency between operational databases and applications will also be outlined.

## Title: The Compression Session
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2008 allows you to compress your data in several different ways. Your tables can be compressed using row compression or page compression, and your can also choose to compress your backups. In this session we'll look at what kinds of data give you the most space savings when compressed, and we'll also discuss the algorithms SQL Server uses to compress your data. Knowing how SQL Server performs compression will allow us to evalutate when the space savings will be worth the cost, and when you might want to avoid compression.

## Title: Tuna Helper for DBAs and Developers
 
**Abstract**:
Many DBAs and developers are faced with tuning poorly performing SQL statements. There is no way to learn everything you need to know about SQL tuning in an hour, but you can learn a process to employ when badly written SQLs are ruining database performance. However, many tuning projects fail because the process being used is inefficient. This presentation will walk through a process I use with great success and it will include topics such as: SQL diagramming, wait type data, column selectivity, and others that will help you succeed on future tuning projects.

## Title: SQL Server for the Oracle DBA
 
**Abstract**:
Come hear Buck Woody, Microsoft's "Real World DBA" give a marketing-free introduction to SQL Server for the Oracle professional. No experience in SQL Server is necessary - we'll cover the basics of SQL Server Architecture using Oracle concepts as a guide. If you're an Oracle professional and you want to add SQL Server to your "knowledge arsenal", come hear this overview. You'll also get a list of resources that will enable you to research further.

## Title: SSIS Performance Design Patterns
 
**Abstract**:
Need a fast data integration solution, but don't have the time or budget for heavy performance tuning? Come learn how to maximize your ROI by applying trusted design patterns to your Integration Services packages. We talk about how to set performance expectations, and how to put together a simple framework to record benchmarks for your ETL process. We go over the basics of smart package design, and then look at a number of design patterns for common data warehousing problems, such as Slowly Changing Dimension processing, Range Lookups, and Change Detection.

## Title: Exploring SQL Server System Information with DMVs
 
**Abstract**:
This session will explore different DMV and how they can be used to obtain information about your SQL Server environment.    There will be a number of demo's.  In these demos different DMV's will be used provide different infomation about how your SQL Server instance is running.  Peeking under the covers is now only a DMV away.

## Title: Data Warehouse Dimension Processing with SSIS
 
**Abstract**:
The SCD Wizard included in Integration Services is easy to use, and has all the features you need for smaller, simple dimension processing. However, it is not the easiest component to adjust, and doesn't perform very well with larger dimensions. This session will cover three alternative techniques for processing changes to dimension tables within SSIS: "rolling your own SCD" with Lookups and Conditional Splits, using the T-SQL MERGE statement, and the Kimball Method SCD component. The strengths and weaknesses of each technique will be described and demonstrated.
