## Title: A Game of Hierarchies: From GROUP BY to Recursive CTEs
 
**Abstract**:
Hierarchies are the bread and butter of most business applications and you find them almost everywhere:
* Product Categories
* Sales Territories
* Calendar and Time
Even when there is a big need from a business perspective, the solutions in relational databases are still sort of awkward. Since Version 2008, SQL Server makes life a bit easier with the data type hierarchyid. If you want to successfully query self-referenced hierarchies, you will need recursive common table expressions. To make use of aggregations, you have to master GROUP BY clauses, as well as GROUPING SETS, CUBE, ROLLUP, WITH CUBE, and WITH ROLLUP.
If these terms caught your attention, then join this session for a journey through best practices to model your hierarchies and handy scripts to transform your hierarchies into useful information. We will have fun playing around with a sample database based on G. R. R. Martin’s famous "Game of Thrones".

## Title: Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Algorithms
 
**Abstract**:
Machine learning service is Microsoft Azure drag and drop tool for building,testing and deploying any kind of predictive model on your data-set. Finalized solution is published and used by daily business in larger stack of your Microsoft Azure services. With easy and interactive creation of models, algorithms and decisions do not tend to be that simple! Especially when one has to make business decision on results.

Focus on this session will be mathematical and graphical explanation of algorithms available for predictive analytics in Azure Machine Learning service. Algorithms - grouped by learning type - will be examined and crossed referenced through all available and ready-to-use. Understanding the the basics - data inference, data splitting, data stratification, to sweeping, to theory of algorithms: regression, decision trees, Clustering and Naive Bayes. We will clarify the confusion over algorithms, suitable data for algorithms and what type of problem can be tackled with.

## Title: Tuning Problem Queries in Table Partitioning
 
**Abstract**:
Table partitioning is a fantastic tool to help you manage tables with skyrocketing rowcounts. SQL Server 2016 SP1 made table partitioning available in Standard Edition, so you may be planning to add partitioning to your database. But some queries may get slower after you partition your tables: the SQL Server optimizer doesn't always use indexes the same way after those indexes are partitioned into chunks. In this session you will learn how to use execution plans to troubleshoot regressed queries using partitioned tables. You will learn what "non-aligned" indexes are, how to tell how many partitions a query is really using, and a variety of methods to speed up your queries.

## Title: Data Science for beginners
 
**Abstract**:
Data science can be hard to grasp, complex and big, but making data science easy to understand and bringing it closer to all who want to tackle this new emerging field is an important task in world of data.  Exploring, extracting and finding hidden gems  from data using statistical and mathematical methods, computer science and several different technologies is essentially what data science is doing. In practice this means, data science is an iterative process of harvesting data, managing and cleaning the data,  performing analysis and and at the end interpreting, visualizing and using information  that will bring insights to end-user, business people and making decisions much easier.
We will focus on answering 5 simple questions. 

1) is this weird? 
2) is A better than B, respectively? 
3) how much / many of this is needed? 
4) this belong to group A? 
5) what is next?

Session we will look into technologies that can be tackled using SQL Server 2016 and ML Azure.

## Title: Advanced BIML - for the advanced ETL developer
 
**Abstract**:
This is not your regular Agile BIML session. By now you already know that BIML is a great productivity enhancement to SSIS. You also know that you can build metadata driven solution and include C# code in your BIML scripts or snippets. If you don't know what I'm talking about this session is not for you. If you - on the other hand - want to know how to build a modular BIML framework, do real C# development and include it in your BIML code so that you can pass custom objects around for optimized performance and code reuse then this session is for you. We will see how to build a reusable C# framework that can be obfuscated and deployed to customers without worrying about Intellectual property. I promise you no more than a few slides but a lot of demos and real life experience acquired from major BIML projects. We will also have a look at how to harness integration and unit tests in the setup with a twist of Continuous Integration with Team Foundation Server.

## Title: Delivering changes for databases and applications
 
**Abstract**:
In the world of agile software development, the database development process introduces some challenges to the application development process. The delivery of changes at database level tend to be a different and separated process of the application delivery process, or even an entirely manual process. This contributes to the perspective that the database is a bottleneck in the agile process.
In this session, we will explore the aspects that bring closer and distinguishes databases from the applications. We will share methodologies and strategies that allows to bring together databases and applications in the development process reducing the delivery pain.
The final purpose is to understand that applications and databases do not need to live in different worlds with different development processes.

## Title: RAD with MDS
 
**Abstract**:
If you think about RAD tools, you think about Visual Studio LightSwitch, Project Sienna or even Power Apps. But usually you don't think about Microsoft SQL Server Master Data Services. 
MDS makes the administration and maintenance of your master data quite easy and comfortable. But in more and more projects, we no longer use MDS only as a master data system. Every time you need a small list, a maintainable table, something where somebody can store in any manner manageable information – we use Master Data Services. 
From the simple management of SSIS jobs to a complex forecasting or annual planning system. With MDS you can create very quickly and easily applications for the processing of well-structured data. And together with the Excel AddIn directly for an environment with a high degree of acceptance. With SQL Server 2016, many more features have been added, to even more simplify the rapid application development process.
In this session, we will show different development approach

## Title: Best practices validation with DBATools
 
**Abstract**:
As DBA we need to perform a lot of repetitive tasks. We also want to know the current state of our environments. What if we have a PowerShell module that help us with those tasks? That module is DBATools.
Have you ever need to verify if best practices are in use? How do you do it when you have dozens if not hundreds or thousands of SQL servers? One by one?
And, what if you have to apply the best practices on those SQL servers? You will also do it one by one?

In this session we will see how easy, fast, precise and less error prone can be validate if a set of SQL servers is respecting the best practices and if not how we can configure them to just by using a set of commands from DBATools module. 

This module is one of the most popular tools among DBAs and is developed and maintained by more than 30 contributors from the community. We have PowerShell and SQL Server MVPs, DBAs, developers and QA people.
If you do not know this tool or if you want to learn more this is a great oppo

## Title: Columnstore killed the OLAP-Star: Did it really?
 
**Abstract**:
With increasing speed in relational query execution classical analytical solutions get challenged more and more. Why loose time for processing data into multi-dimensional databases? Why analyze outdated data if you can have fresh data instead? We are analyzing typical scenarios from classical multi-dimensional analysis like YTD calculation, DistinctCount and others in regards to their efficiency with different solution approaches: Classical multi-dimensional databases in ROLAP mode, DirectQuery, T-SQL… And we are going to show how Columnstore indexes are influencing those solutions. Find out about advantages and disadvantages of the different solutions in regards to the problem. And maybe you will discover new approaches for your own challenges.

## Title: Recovery Models Made SIMPLE
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server always logs every change to a database. But exactly what is logged can vary based on a number of factors. Some operations are referred to as "minimally logged," but even those operations can log a different level of detail depending on your recovery model. This session looks inside the transaction log to see exactly what is logged for minimally logged operations. First, we look at some background information regarding how the log is used and managed, and then we introduce a tool that can help you actually see your log records. When you can query the log, you can determine how logging for operations such as index rebuilds and SELECT INTO differs depending on whether you are using the FULL or BULK_LOGGED recovery model. We also look at other factors in our SQL Server operations that can affect what is actually written to the log. In addition, I’ll describe the benefits and caveats for each of the recovery models.

## Title: My Favorite Pie (Chart): Simple Rules for Clear Visualizations
 
**Abstract**:
Dataviz guru Stephen Few once stated that we should “save the pies for dessert”. What he meant is that pie charts are good in some specific use cases, but they should not be used in others. The same is true for other chart types. Using the wrong type of chart will make it harder for report users to understand the story behind the data. To enable insights, information has to be presented in the most intuitive way possible. You will leave this session with five easy-to-implement rules, which will guide you through the process of creating clear and attractive visualizations.

## Title: A Look Inside SQL Server Distribution Statistics
 
**Abstract**:
Where do the estimated rowcount values come from? Look inside SQL Server’s distribution statistics to see how they are used to come up with the estimates. We’ll also discuss changes in the cardinality estimator in recent versions and look at some new metadata that gives us more statistics information.

Goals:
•	Explore the output of DBCC SHOW_STATISTICS
•	Describe when the density information is useful
•	Look at some problem scenarios for which the statistics can’t give good estimates
•	Understand why cardinality estimation involves more than just the statistics
