## Title: High Availability and Azure - Scaling SQL Server to the Cloud
 
**Abstract**:
Has your manager come to you and said "I expect the SQL Server machines to have zero downtime?" Have you been told to make your environment "Always On" without any guidance (or budget) as to how to do that or what that means? This session will walk you through the high availability options in on-premises SQL Server, the high availability options in Azure SQL Database, and how those can be combined to enable you to achieve the ambitious goals of your management. Beyond the academic knowledge, we'll discuss real world case studies covering exactly how your on-premises environments and Azure services can work together to keep your phone quiet at night.

## Title: Characteristics of a Great Relational Database
 
**Abstract**:
When queried, most database professionals would mention normalized as one of the most important characteristics that tell the difference between a good and bad relational database design (whether they know what the term "normalized" means or not.) Normalization is a key to great relational designs, but there is so much more to be considered. A normalized database that suffers from poor naming, too many or too few indexes, terrible interfaces, and so on can derail your design's value to the user.  In this session I will present primary characteristics of a design that differentiates between an ugly design that will have your colleagues nitpicking you to death and one that will have them singing your praises. Characteristics such as comprehendible, documented, secure, well performing, and more (including normalized, naturally) will be discussed.

## Title: Using Extended Events for Wait Stats Analysis
 
**Abstract**:
When troubleshooting overall server performance, wait statistics are a great place to start. But when your SQL Server hosts a complex set of workloads, it can be difficult to narrow down which queries are causing the most wait, and what types of wait they are causing. Fortunately, SQL Server provides easy ways for targeting which queries are causing you the most wait time. In this session, we’ll learn how to use both Extended Events, and Dynamic Management Views for examining wait statistics from the instance level to the database level, all the way down to the individual query level. We’ll analyze poorly performing queries using a combination of methods including T-SQL queries and SQL 2017’s new XEvent Profiler, and show how to quickly narrow down what SQL Server is waiting for, and why.

## Title: Inside Kubernetes - An Architectural Deep Dive
 
**Abstract**:
In this session we will introduce Kubernetes, we’ll deep dive into each component and its responsibility in a cluster. We will also look at and demonstrate higher-level abstractions such as Services, Controllers, and Deployments and how they can be used to ensure the desired state of an application and data platform deployed in Kubernetes. Next, we’ll look at Kubernetes networking and intercluster communication patterns. With that foundation, we will then introduce various cluster scenarios such as a single node, single head, and high availability designs. By the end of this session, you will understand what's needed to put your applications and data platform in production in a Kubernetes cluster

Session Objectives:
Understand Kubernetes cluster architecture

## Title: Revenge: The SQL!
 
**Abstract**:
Pop quiz DBA: Your developers are running rampant in production. Logic, reason, and threats have all failed. You're on the edge. What do you do? WHAT DO YOU DO?
Hint: You attend Revenge: The SQL! 
This session will show you how to "correct" all those bad practices. Everyone logging in as sa? Running huge cursors? Using SELECT * in ad-hoc SQL? Stop them dead, without actually killing them. Ever dropped a table, or database, or WHERE clause? You can prevent that! And if you’re tired of folks ignoring your naming conventions, make them behave with Unicode…and take your revenge!
Revenge: The SQL! is fun and educational and may even have some practical use, but you’ll want to attend simply to indulge your Dark Side. Revenge: The SQL! assumes no liability and is not available in all 50 states. Do not taunt Revenge: The SQL! or Happy Fun Ball.

## Title: PowerShell for the DBA
 
**Abstract**:
PowerShell is a tool used by many people in DevOps and Infrastructure. Should the DBA get on board with using PowerShell? The answer is yes - as a DBA, PowerShell can have a significant impact on tasks that would be long and tedious with just T-SQL alone. Today there are specific modules that can be incorporated into PowerShell to help in automating every-day DBA tasks. Beyond that, PowerShell can be used to do things like automate deployments and audit permissions. 

In this session we will explore real-world examples and demonstrate how PowerShell can be leveraged by the DBA to not only improve efficiency but also streamline processes across an enterprise environment.

## Title: PowerShell for the Reluctant Administrator
 
**Abstract**:
You've heard many people claim that PowerShell is fabulous, but you've never really felt the need for it. What's all the fuss? What is PowerShell and why should you even care, much less learn it? How will this new toy make your work easier?

This session will help you understand what PowerShell is, how it integrates into the tools you know and love, and how it can help make your everyday work go faster and more smoothly. Along with the background on PowerShell, you'll see some simple but useful tools and ideas for how you can use those tools and make your own tools too.

This session was designed for the non-PowerShell user and the new PowerShell user. It is intended to help people understand what PowerShell is and start to use PowerShell, and it will touch on advanced ideas but only assumes only basic scripting/coding experience like understanding a variable, a loop, etc.

## Title: Is My Application Bias Showing?
 
**Abstract**:
Computers can't be biased, right?  I mean, it's just lines of code.  Yes or No.  Ones  Zeros.  Those lines of code are written by people.  People have life experiences that color how they see the world.  Okay, let's be blunt.  People have baggage.  And that baggage is seeping into your application, surveys and web forms.  
You've got an idea for a new app and it's going to change the world! Right?  It's a brilliant idea  no one has ever thought of it before.   You're working on the GUI for your company's web portal and you know just what information to collect from the user.  Are you sure about that?  Odds are pretty good that the information you're going to collect is a reflection of your life  your experiences.  
Learn how to identify bias when it seeps in, how to code to be inclusive instead of exclusive , and some quick tips  tricks to make sure you're accounting for all the users that will use YOUR application to change the world.  Instead of just the ones that look like you.

## Title: Taming of the Shrew - Optimizing Power BI
 
**Abstract**:
No one wants to tell a report user that while running a report in Power BI they have time to go get a cup of coffee…in another town.  Although data sets will often be the focus of performance issues, it’s important to know how to locate performance problems in Power BI and how to eliminate them.  

This session will take the Power User through how to identify time consuming processing in Power BI and how to address it through step-by-step and proven methods used to optimize in multi-tier environments.  This method removes frustration and finger-pointing and gets to the heart of the problem with a goal of correcting performance challenges.  The results are satisfied end users who get the information they need, when they need it.

Take Aways:
Learn how to identify what is taking the time in a Power BI data set and report.
Understand the logging and tracing mechanisms and capabilities in the environment.
Understand when a problem is really a problem.

## Title: Query Tuning Internals for the Advanced SQL Developer
 
**Abstract**:
Skilled SQL developers know that the SQL Server Query Optimizer uses a multi-step process to produce execution plans. But what about deeper components like the parser, the binder, the algebrizer, as well as the optimizer itself? This session will teach you advanced techniques for query tuning as well as surprising behaviors of the query optimization process that can have a dramatic impact on performance, with special attention paid to the transformations applied by the algebrizer, including associative, commutative, and transitive transforms. We will examine a variety of everyday queries whose performance can be greatly improved by applying a deeper understanding of these internal behaviors. Lots of examples and demos!

## Title: SQL Server Take Over:  Establishing a Baseline
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Take Over:  Establishing a Baseline

Performance assessment and tuning for the beginner DBA
 
Have you ever inherited a group of servers with not a lot of documentation to accompany them?   Do you have a lot of undocumented or new servers in your environment and you want to establish some baseline configuration setting prior to making changes? You need up to date information on the system very quickly. 
 
The server is running slowly... or is it? Slow compared to what?  Before you being digging into performance issues, there are some baseline metrics you should have established. Only after the information has been gathered, can a plan of attack be developed to help resolve issues with performance. Attendees in this session will learn how to quickly  gather information, review the results and get an action plan on the next step in performance tuning.

## Title: Continuous Learning for the Modern Age
 
**Abstract**:
You have read this far, great!  I already know this session is for you. How do I know? It is exceedingly rare that today’s “9-5” job provides anywhere near what is needed to develop the career you want to have.  For the purposes of this session it does not matter if you are a newly minted, “wet behind the ears” data professional or a grizzled veteran.  What does matter is that you know that you have a career oriented mindset and a desire to grow beyond what you are today.

This session is designed to help with just that. In addition to talking about a learning plan that fits your needs, we will discuss how to execute that plan, including lab environments, as well as resources to help you execute those plans.  If you have reached this point, you simply need to be in this session, see you there.

## Title: Very Large Databases in your future
 
**Abstract**:
Your databases may not be terabyte-sized yet, but they're probably growing every day. We'll look at lessons learned 
from working with multi-terabyte, very large databases (VLDBs) in the real world. Topics include storage layout 
decisions, unique tuning challenges, HA/DR implications, and database restores, along with shoehorning backups, re-
indexing and DBCC checks into itty-bitty maintenance windows. As a bonus, many of the techniques also apply to smaller databases and consolidated servers that run hundreds of databases.

## Title: Modern SQL Server Security Features for Developers
 
**Abstract**:
In SQL Server and Azure SQL Database, the relational engine has been greatly enhanced for security with three new features that you’ll learn about in this demo-packed session. With dynamic data masking (DDM), you can fully or partially conceal sensitive columns from query results. Masking does not modify data on in the table, it simply hides data from users that don’t have permission to see it. Row-level security (RLS) also hides data from unauthorized users, but at the row level. With RLS, you can create your own security policy to control which users can read or write specific rows in the table. Finally, Always Encrypted (AE) uses client-side encryption to ensure that data is encrypted in flight, not just at rest. Furthermore, the encryption keys are accessible only to the client. This guarantees that data cannot be decrypted on the server, easing the migration path to the cloud for users with highly sensitive data.

## Title: Weird Stuff I Saw While ... Working With Heaps
 
**Abstract**:
We've all been told at some point that heaps are usually bad for select, update, and delete performance. But how bad are they really? Can they also be problematic for worloads that are _mostly_ insert? Are they always recommended for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations? Does it help to create non-clustered indexes on top of heaps? For this installment of Rick's "Weird Stuff" series we will take a closer look at why heaps can cause issues and maybe see a deadlock or two.

With Rubrik, we empower you to backup and restore your databases quickly and with ease. Come see how you can quickly protect hundreds of databases with just a few clicks or bring back a database in minutes to satisfy your most demanding executives. With Rubrik, it's not about backing up, it's about going forward!

## Title: Learn History from Temporal Tables
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2016 came out with a bucket full of cool new features. One of them is Temporal Tables. SQL Server 2017 made some enhancements in this area. Temporal tables are basically history tables of the normal tables; that allows us to retrieve data from any point in time for every change such as updates and deletes. It does this all without any change to application code and without needing any triggers. In this session, we will see what the requirements of creating temporal tables are. We will see the demo on insert and update functionality and how to query historical information using new TSQL clause. We will touch upon retention of history as well. It has lots of demos and less theory.

## Title: SQL Server 2019 Big Data Clusters
 
**Abstract**:
One of the most significant announcements in SQL Server history came in September 2018; the addition of SQL Server Big Data Clusters to the 2019 release. Combining big data tools such as HDFS and Spark with SQL Server into a single platform has tremendous potential. The change to platform architecture and administration, however, is extensive. In this session we we review the capabilities enabled by Big Data Clusters and become familiar with some necessary technologies that may be new to many, such as Kubernetes.  Most of the time will be spent in demos of how the platform works.

## Title: Applying Data Warehousing Principles
 
**Abstract**:
Many data analysts typically begin to work with data as a single flat table. While this works for small datasets, as the size of the data grows these naive methods do not scale. Processing records takes longer, queries become more complex, and introducing new datasets is inconsistent at best. In order to solve these problems, we must take into account the underlying architecture of our data and how it should be modeled. During this talk we will discuss key concepts, patterns, and techniques for designing a data model that is simple to query, scales with your data, and is extendable to new datasets.

**Abstract**:
Data collection and usage is all around us, it is what we do. But is what we do with the data ethical? Are we collecting and processing biased data?  We will take a look at ethical data collection and usage, what it means to your models and forecasts, and how being aware of possible biases can impact your bottom line.

## Title: Cleaning Is Half The Battle: Launching A Data Science Project
 
**Abstract**:
There's an old adage in software development: Garbage In, Garbage Out. This adage certainly applies to data science projects: if you simply throw raw data at models, you will end up with garbage results. In this session, we will build an understanding of just what it takes to implement a data science project whose results are not garbage. We will use the Microsoft Team Data Science Process as our model for project implementation, learning what each step of the process entails. To motivate this walkthrough, we will see what we can learn from a survey of data professionals' salaries.

## Title: How I Would Attack SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
This isn’t a talk about best practices or how to configure your system. It’s designed to get into the mindset of a motivated, equipped adversary who wants to get in to a system or application, specifically SQL Server, and uses the full extent of his or her creativity to do so. We’ll look at both traditional and non-traditional weak points, how an attacker discovers them, exploits them, and then covers up his or her tracks. We’ll also discuss what we can do to compensate for a weakness we can’t fix, which revolves mostly around detection and response and how an attacker will respond to such countermeasures.
