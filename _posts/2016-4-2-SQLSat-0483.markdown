## Title: Design and Implement BI Like Edison! 
 
**Abstract**:
As the most prolific inventor in American history, Thomas Edison was a master of “Best Practices!” Edison’s creations were not just novel and commercially successful, but many launched entire new industries including electric light and power, sound recording, motion pictures and industrial cement and concrete manufacture. At the heart of Edison’s remarkable record of innovation was his categorization of the innovation process into “competencies,” or bundles of skills supporting the achievement of success in a particular area of endeavor. In this session, we will look at ways that we can use many of these broad success secrets to bring powerful tools and strategies to the recurring implementation of business intelligence.

## Title: Power BI is Awesome!
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft has changed its Business Intelligence strategy in the last few years from an IT centric approach with SQL Server Reporting Services and SQL Server Analysis Services to an end-user ad-hoc approach with Power BI. Initially the Power BI tools were all separate add-ons to Excel 2010+ that you had to know where to get them and install/activate them individually. Now with new Power BI product announcements and Power BI Desktop, the full vision of these once separate tools is becoming more clear and cohesive as an end-user ad-hoc analysis and reporting tool. In this demo heavy session you will see how Power BI is now a much more complete solution and how it can change how you deliver analysis and reporting to anyone in your company. Demos will include using Power BI Desktop to pull in data from multiple sources and repeatable transformations to clean usable data and build interactive reports and dashboards.

## Title: Overcoming Chartaphobia And Moving Toward Enlightening Data Viz
 
**Abstract**:
Do your organization's reports consist mostly of giant tables of data? Perhaps you have gotten as far as adding KPI indicators or conditional highlighting to the tables. Although tables of data presented as reports are commonly found in many organizations, they may be doing you and your users a disservice. You should optimize your data viz just as you optimize your databases. Reports are a user interface that must be purposefully designed to help users achieve their goal of making informed decisions. In this session, we'll review requirements gathering and data viz best practices and apply those concepts to the use of Microsoft reporting tools such as Excel, Power View, and Reporting Services. You'll leave with guidance on how to take boring, unreadable tables of data and turn them into useful and visually appealing reports.

## Title: The New Revolution in Data Science, R Integrated into SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Data Science is an ever increasing topic in the Data Analytics space and the R language is at the center of most conversations. R is an open source statistical language that is rapidly gaining popularity due to a robust set of machine learning functionality and a never-ending set of R packages that are used to increase functionality of the core R language. The R language is run as a desktop application and was not built with performance and scale required to accommodate Big Data. Revolution Analytics, a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft, has solved the performance and scaling issues of a desktop application by creating a more robust enterprise architecture. SQL Server 2016 brings the power of R and Revolution Analytics into the industry leading relational database. 

This session will demo the functionality and power of using R within SQL Server.

## Title: Revenge: The SQL! - Director's Cut
 
**Abstract**:
Pop quiz DBA: Your developers are running rampant in production. Logic, reason, and threats have all failed. You're on the edge. What do you do? WHAT DO YOU DO?

Hint: You attend Revenge: The SQL! 

This session will show you how to "correct" all those bad practices. Everyone logging in as sa? Running huge cursors? Using SELECT * and ad-hoc SQL? Stop them dead, without actually killing them. Ever dropped a table, or database, or WHERE clause? You can prevent that! And if you’re tired of folks ignoring your naming conventions, make them behave with Unicode…and take your revenge!

Revenge: The SQL! is fun and educational and may even have some practical use, but you’ll want to attend simply to indulge your Dark Side. Revenge: The SQL! assumes no liability and is not available in all 50 states. Do not taunt Revenge: The SQL! or Happy Fun Ball.

## Title: FROM OLD TO NEW; NAVIGATING THE CHOPPY WATERS OF A CRM/ERP PLATFORM MIGRATI
 
**Abstract**:
The time has come -- you’ve lived with your legacy Customer Relationship Management/Enterprise Resource Planning systems since you joined the company, but they’re not cutting it anymore. A decision is made to move to a new vendor, a new platform, a new CRM/ERP software package, and you’ve been tapped to be part of the project team. Your job will be to make sure that the data collected in the old systems is successfully and accurately ported to the new systems. Really?

What do you have to look forward to? What’s it going to be like? How are you going to do this? Will you port all of the data from the legacy system to the new one, or just some? How will that work?

Join Michelle Poolet as she walks you through lessons learned from the many platform migrations that she’s been part of. As a data architect, Michelle has special insight into these massively complex projects, which she’d like to share with you.

## Title: SQL Server Internals and Architecture
 
**Abstract**:
Let’s face it.  You can effectively do many IT jobs related to SQL Server without knowing the internals of how SQL Server works.  Many great developers, DBAs, and designers get their day-to-day work completed on time and with reasonable quality while never really knowing what’s happening behind the scenes.  But if you want to take your skills to the next level, it’s critical to know SQL Server’s internal processes and architecture.  This session will answer questions like:

-	What are the various areas of memory inside of SQL Server?
-	How are queries handled behind the scenes?
-	What does SQL Server do with procedural code, like functions, procedures, and triggers?
-	What happens during checkpoints?  Lazywrites?
-	How are IOs handled with regards to transaction logs and database?
-	What happens when transaction logs and databases grow or shrinks?

This fast paced session will take you through many aspects of the internal operations of SQL Server and, for those topics we don’t

## Title: Infrastructure Tuning for SQL Server Performance
 
**Abstract**:
Mention SQL Server performance to any DBA, and the impulse is to dive headfirst into the database and queries. However, if the infrastructure underneath the data is your performance bottleneck, the time spent tuning at the database layer is usually in vain. Server hardware, operating system parameters, storage, interconnects, and networking will all be discussed in depth in terms that DBAs can relate to. Practical architecture guidelines and troubleshooting techniques will be presented so you can analyze your environments and see if your performance bottlenecks are where you think they are.
