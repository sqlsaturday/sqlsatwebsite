## Title: Creating and Managing a Power BI Enterprise Deployment
 
**Abstract**:
When implementing Power BI in any enterprise, there are many options that the project team faces, and the choices are not always obvious. The different approaches are often dictated by organisational constraints, which are often different for many organisations. In this presentation, Craig will take you on a journey of discovery about the different best practices and options you have when implementing Power BI in your enterprise. Among others, we will discuss topics such as:
•	The different data storage and connectivity modes.
•	Power BI Pro vs Power BI Premium.
•	Efficient use of workspaces and apps.
•	Security Considerations.
•	Content Governance.
•	How all of the above (and other) topics impact your implementation.
Craig will bring his extensive real-world experience to this presentation, in which the audience is encouraged to participate in the discussion.

## Title: High Availability and Disaster Recovery for SQL Server in Azure IaaS
 
**Abstract**:
The CEO just tasked you with moving all the SQL Server instances to Azure, or maybe you are deploying a brand new application and want to leverage Azure IaaS to host SQL Server. Beyond security and performance, your most pressing concern might be ensuring SQL Server running in Azure is highly available.
 
While on-prem high availability and disaster recovery options for SQL Server are well defined, moving those instances to Azure immediately presents some questions and challenges. Can I simply lift and shift my SQL Server Failover Cluster Instance to the cloud? Do I need to upgrade to SQL Server Enterprise Edition and us Always On Availability Groups? What about shared storage and failover clustering? What about disaster recovery, what are my options there? Load Balancers, Fault Domains, Availability Zones, Azure Site Recovery and Region Pairs, what are these things and why do they matter to me? 

HA and DR professional Jason Aw with 20 years of experience explains all this and more in

## Title: How to Deploy SQL Server Containers on Kubernetes in Azure
 
**Abstract**:
When Microsoft released SQL Server 2017 it allowed us to run SQL Server in docker containers. This radical change provides a wider and open platform that data professionals can choose how to deploy and run SQL Server. 

This session will demonstrate how containers are a game changer for deploying and managing SQL Server.  It  will also showcase how the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a scalable and highly available platform for SQL Server running in containers. 

Demonstrations will show how easy it is to create containers, deploy SQL Server in them and how to automate and manage your SQL Server containers using Kubernetes on the Azure platform.

This session will show you the exciting future of SQL Server and you will walk away with knowledge of practical scenarios where SQL Server running in containers on Kubernetes may be the right deployment model for you.

## Title: Smart Alerts for Azure SQL Database using Automation  Logic Apps
 
**Abstract**:
If you've dipped your toe into the waters of Azure SQL DB, you'll know that there's no SQL Agent available. Fortunately there are many options available to get you over this hurdle. One of these is Azure Automation, a scheduling engine which runs PowerShell or Python scripts to perform your tasks. As a bonus, these Runbooks can also be triggered from Azure SQL DB alerts. This session will introduce Azure Automation, from a basic, manually executed Runbook to an alert-driven responsive utility that can save you considerable effort. We'll then take Alert responses a step further and use them to trigger an Azure Logic App workflow - a utility that provides a robust workspace with built-in scalability  retry logic along with a multitude of connectors which can expand the response to your alert. Imagine being able to capture an Alert, perform the remedial action, log the issue  response in your ticketing system and switch on your kettle so you can sit back and let Azure do it all for you.

## Title: Test Driven Development in SQL Server – how to deploy code safer
 
**Abstract**:
Test Driven Development (TDD)  is a design approach which has enabled application developers to write cleaner code. It is relevant for database development as it ensures that code produced using TDD and unit tests will be of higher quality which means interactions with data will be safer. 

TDD is not a new method of unit testing, it is an essential design practice for improving the quality of your deployed code.

In this session it will be shown how we can use TDD to design and write better unit tests using open-source frameworks and industry standard tools. These tools can be run within SQL Server Management Studio which means DBAs can also take advantage of TDD and unit test, to ensure more reliable code is deployed to databases. 
TDD can result in code that can be deployed more reliably and faster when using DevOps processes such as Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. 

A comprehensive DEMO will reveal how Test Driven Development can help you deploy database code

In this demo based session we will look into:
- What information is available 
- How it can be used.
- Techniques to improve performance. 

Attendees will leave with an understanding of possibilities of turning queries and a roadmap for further learning.

This session will assume a basic knowledge of T-SQL and execution plans.

## Title: Get your data flowing with Data Flows! and...umm...dataflows
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft recently launched Data Flows in Azure Data Factory (ADF) to move the service beyond the pure orchestration space into the world of extract, transform and load (ETL). At roughly the same time, Microsoft also introduced dataflows into the Power BI service world, allowing users to leverage common query models across an enterprise. So, what do we do with these new offerings? What are they, really? Is Microsoft just trying to confuse us? This session untangles and explores ADF Data Flows and Power BI dataflows to help you to get a better understanding of how you may be able to apply them in your world.

## Title: SQL Server Upgrades and Migrations - The Right Way
 
**Abstract**:
There has been lots of focus recently on upgrades and migrations with the end-of-life of SQL Server 2008 and 2008R2.

With so many critical databases running on these older versions, how do you ensure that you achieve a successful and safe transition to your new platform? Fortunately there are some fantastic tools and defined processes that can lead you through each stage. 

There are tools to test different versions and infrastructures, processes to track query regressions and provide a way to remediate them.

This session will walk through the upgrade process from end-to-end and show what tools can help you at each step.

## Title: Making the leap from Excel formulas to DAX
 
**Abstract**:
DAX is easy until it's hard.   The same thing applies to Excel formulas.   The advantage of Excel is you can see exactly which cells are being referenced and you see the immediate answer of your calculation.
DAX formulas are written in isolation with the author having to "picture" the context of where that calculation will be used.
This session compares and contrasts calculations in Excel formulas and DAX formulas to give you a better comprehension on how to tackle DAX.
Tips, tricks and best practice ideas will set you up for more powerful Excel and Power BI reporting.

## Title: Paginated Reporting with Power BI
 
**Abstract**:
Interactive reporting has changed the way that organisations share and consume information. Users can slice and dice their data in so many ways without needing to ask developers to change the reports. However, most organisations do still need paginated (fixed format) reports as well. 

In this session, Craig will discuss the various options available for implementing paginated reports in the cloud and/or on-premises using Power BI. We will explore this in depth from all angles so that you can come away understanding these options and implications.
