## Title: Query Tuning Mastery: Manhandling Parallelism
 
**Abstract**:
In today's multi-core-driven world, query performance is very much determined by how well you're taking advantage of the processing power at your disposal. In this session you will learn how to take full advantage of parallelism, from a developer's point of view. After a quick terminology review and technology refresher the session will go deep, covering T-SQL patterns that allow certain queries to scale almost linearly across your multi-core CPUs. Not all T-SQL queries can go parallel, so you'll also learn to watch for those things that can restrict the query optimizer's decisions. Along the way you'll learn to manipulate costs and row goals, challenge generally accepted tuning practices, and take complete control of your parallel queries.

## Title: Super-size Your SSIS Breakfast Sandwich: Performan
 
**Abstract**:
Importing data is as common to SQL Server as bacon is to a savory breakfast sandwich. As most of us love to eat those breakfast sandwiches, SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) loves to eat data in an Import/Export kind of way. Although a green chain of boxes in SSIS can be the ruling “Happy Dance” of any DBA or SQL Developer, we must still consider the performance of those tasks. In this session, we will go through performance tuning in SSIS 2012 after a successful SSIS package has been developed. When we are finished with this session, not only will you still have the mystic of green colors of successful execution of your SSIS import and export tasks, but the turbo boosters will be turned on as well.

## Title: Table Vars  Temp Tables - What you NEED to Know!
 
**Abstract**:
Almost every SQL Developer is familiar with Table Variables and Temporary Tables. While each of these objects represent temporary storage, there are also substantial differences between them. Understanding the differences between Table Variables and Temporary Tables, and the ramifications that those differences cause, is essential to being able to properly select the appropriate object for use in your development tasks. In this code filled session, we’ll discover the differences and similarities of Temporary Tables and Table Variables, dispel some widespread myths about each, and answer the most important questions of them all, "When do I use one or the other and what are the various impacts of doing so?"

## Title: SQL Server is the Least of My Problems!
 
**Abstract**:
You’ve finally gotten your first job working with SQL Server (SS) as the junior DBA at company XYZ. All the studying, the classes, the pricey SS certification exams,  the User Group attendance has paid off.

Your first day at the job your boss walks you through some new job duties. He wants you to remote out to the server to look at the file directory where the FTP process writes the encrypted files  make sure the file share didn’t disappear when the cluster failed over. You slip away to the bathroom, lock yourself in a stall, have a seat and rock side to side muttering -What is he talking about?I thought there would be tables.

If this sounds familiar this session is for you. Learn about the SS ecosystem  how to navigate it as a new

## Title: Being the Swiss Army Knife of DB Pros
 
**Abstract**:
Being a specialist means you're really, really good at one thing. Being a generalist means you're good at a a lot of different things. The generalist has an advantage over the specialist because he or she can see and solve problems the specialists can't. In this session I'll cover why it's important to diversify your skill set, not only for career protection, but to be better as a database professional. We'll look at what skill sets to build on to expand your abilities around SQL Server to include the operating system, development, networks, and security. Remember, this saying isn't complete, "Jack of all trades, master of none." The full saying is, "Jack of all trades, master of none, though often times better than master of one."

## Title: Analytical Master Data Management with MDS 2012
 
**Abstract**:
Recent changes in Business Intelligence have placed greater emphasis on on enabling end-user analytics. While compelling in theory, in practice there are many challenges when creating a foundation that supports end-users analytics. Many of these challenges revolve around making consistent reference (i.e. dimensional) data available to end users. This can be addressed using a Master Data Management solution.

This session session will explore ways that Master Data Services 2012 can be used to support the definition and management of master data used to support analytics (BI) solutions. It will start with a high level overview of MDM and MDS 2012, and finish with a demo of an analytical MDM solution.

## Title: Execution Plans a Deep Dive
 
**Abstract**:
It’s one thing to know to look for scans instead of seeks, but if you really want to know what’s going on in an execution plan, you need to dive deep. This session will cover reading execution plans from the basics, but goes way beyond the basics to cover as much of the information available within an execution plan as you might possibly ever need. We’ll go into how to understand how to interpret parameter sniffing and spot when a join operation is not performing the way you would want. We’ll use the graphical plan and the XML behind to thoroughly explore execution plans.
