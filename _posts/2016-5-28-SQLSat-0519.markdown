## Title: New life for Reporting Services: what's up in 2016
 
**Abstract**:
During 2015 PASS Summit, Microsoft announced a roadmap to harmonize and standardize its BI reporting solutions into one unique hybrid scenario.
Reporting Services will play a crucial role in this new architecture. Starting from 2016 release, Reporting Services will be the Microsoft's on-premises solution for BI report delivery, meaning that it will host on-premises standard report as well as mobile report as well as Power BI Desktop report. 
To achieve this goal Reporting Services has been completely revisited and redesigned. Rendering engine has been rewritten in HTML5 to support every modern browser.  
Come to this session to have an overview of the new features introduced in Reporting Service 2016. 
You will see the brand new portal supporting both paginated and mobile reports, how to pin charts to Power BI dashboards, how to position report parameters the way you want, how to export reports to PowerPoint, the new charts introduced and many other exciting outlines.

## Title: DBA Vs. Hacker: Protecting SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
This was never showed before, a Hacker and DBA fighting against the time! The brilliant hacker mind trying to intrude and gain access inside of SQL Server to steal the most valued data using the Kalil Linux distribution when in other side the DBA avoing such achievement by using the security best practice and features available on SQL Server.

A Hacker's goal is to find vulnerabilities in a system and a DBA's goal is to make the environment secure and reliable. In this session we will learn how to protect SQL Server from the various forms of attacks that a smart hacker can throw at you. Let's dig in the Hacker thought process to understand the inception of the attack and how to defeat the invasion. Join with me in this internal session using SQL Server and Kali Linux for the ultimate security showdown!

## Title: Mobile BI with Microsoft tools
 
**Abstract**:
In SQL Server 2016 (currently availabe as a preview) Microsoft added support for mobile reports to Reporting Services.
They also released the Mobile Report Publisher for authoring and creation of mobile reports. This application is based on Datazen technology, a company that Microsoft acquired in April of 2015.
As Microsoft stated, using only one mobile BI app users will access dashboards and reports on mobile devices.

Now developers must choose a tool  for developing BI optimized for mobile devices: SSRS,  Mobile Report Publisher (former Datazen) or Power BI? The question is: which one to choose? What are the key factor for supporting the correct decision? 
We will provide a clear and understandable overview of each product, highlighting strengths and weaknesses.
Based on some real examples we will set out a comparison matrix to find the best way to meet your needs with the right mobile reporting tool.

## Title: SQL Server 2016 Query Store – a flight recorder of your database
 
**Abstract**:
If you are a DBA you know that troubleshooting query performance can become a nightmare, all you have is your current plan cache as a source, and some DMVs to query it. 
With the Query Store feature, SQL Server 2016 saves historical execution plans. Not only that but it also saves the query statistics that go along with those historical plans. This is a great new feature which allows you to track execution plans performance for your queries over time. Similar to an airplane’s flight data recorder, Query Store collects and presents detailed historic information about all queries, greatly simplifying performance tuning by reducing the time to diagnose and resolve issues.

## Title: Azure Data and Storage in a Nutshell
 
**Abstract**:
Azure Data and Storage are one of the main parts of Microsoft Azure. 
It includes many different services like: 
- Azure SQL Database
- Azure SQL Data Warehouse (in preview)
- Azure Data Lake Store (in preview)
- Document DB
- Azure Storage (Blobs, Tables , Queues and File Service)
- Azure Search
- Redis Cache

These storage and data services offer different type of data - relational, noSQL, file service, distributed cache etc.
Often when you work on a design of a cloud solution you need to consider the best option to use some of these services, based on the functionality, throughput, data size and price. 
This talk is comparison between these storage by features and price. We will discuss about the best practices to use some of these services. The presentation also compares Azure Data and Storage services with similar features of other public clouds like AWS.

## Title: A deep dive into SQL Server Plan Cache Management 
 
**Abstract**:
As an experienced DBA you have probably asked yourself questions like how the memory is consumed, is my system well-tuned, and is my memory configuration well defined. In order to understanding such processes as local and global Memory pressure, caches concurrency, adding and removing plans from cache we will go through the internal organization of the plan cache, the metadata available, how SQL Server finds a plan in cache, plan cache sizing, and the plan eviction policy. We will point out the important cache consumers that affect your workload and how to get metadata about them, what are the thresholds in Cache Size Management. At the end you will understand how to monitor the memory consumers in your SQL Server, what are wait types that we need to look for, how to understand if your system is well-tuned and the memory configuration is well defined. You will have a clear understanding of cache plan itself, the problems in cache and how to avoid them.
