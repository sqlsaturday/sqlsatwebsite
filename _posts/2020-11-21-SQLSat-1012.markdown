## Title: The Battle of DBAAS – RDS vs Cloud SQL vs SQL Azure
 
**Abstract**:
The public cloud is making a huge impact on the way enterprises host, manage, and scale their database operations. They can provision new infrastructure at the click of a button, without a lengthy hardware procurement process. Through a range of Database as a Service (DBaaS) options, public cloud vendors now make it easier than ever for organizations to migrate and maintain their databases. But while these solutions address many of the headaches involved in database management such as migration, provisioning, and administration, there are significant differences between the various DBaaS offerings on the market. In this session, we explore these DBaaS solutions provided by the leading cloud platforms, AWS, GCP, and Azure, and compare key features such as the types of the Database Engines on offer, Infrastructure Design Challenges, DR and HA capabilities, Performance Indicators, Pricing and Database Security.

## Title: Modernizing Your Data Platform
 
**Abstract**:
Technology is advancing in an exponential rate, and data is becoming more critical than ever for the business. If you have old on-premise servers running old versions of SQL Server, then you have very good reasons to modernize your data platform. You can improve availability, scalability, performance and security of your databases and applications. You can leverage new features and technologies, and provide a lot more value to your customers and end users. And at the same time, you have the potential to reduce your operational costs.
In this session, we will learn about a structured approach for such a modernization project. We will focus on the Microsoft data platform. We will cover the latest versions of SQL Server as well as Azure SQL Database and Azure Managed Instance. We will learn about migration tools and techniques, such as the Data Migration Assistant (DMA), the Azure Database Migration Service, Transactional Replication, Log Shipping, and more.

## Title: Debugging without debugger: investigating SQL Server’s internal structures
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever wanted to know exactly how SQL Server stores data for temporary structures, such as for instance the spooled data in a Table Spool or Index Spool operator? No? I don’t blame you. It’s a bit like wanting to know who watered the rubber tree that produced the rubber your tires are made off before you get in the car to drive to work. You really don’t need it.
But you might still WANT to know. I did. And I figured it out.
Without ever touching the debugger (I’m a simple soul, that stuff is much too complex for me!), I figured out how I could look at the exact storage structures SQL Server creates and uses to store data in Table Spool and Index Spool operators.
If you are willing to commit to a fast-paced and deep internals session that is guaranteed to teach you exactly zero actually useful information, then this is the session for you.

## Title: Improving Analytics Performance With Columnstore Indexes
 
**Abstract**:
Administrators and analysts often struggle with the storage and maintenance of reporting and analytics data.  Traditional rowstore tables do not scale well when data is measured in billions of rows.

Columnstore indexes provide a speedy and convenient way to store OLAP data within SQL Server.  Compression allows the data to be much smaller than other storage methods, allowing for faster reads.  Column metadata provides the tools needed for SQL Server to be able to service queries over massive data sets quickly and efficiently.

The basics of columnstore indexes allow an administrator to improve the performance of analytics, but there is much more to learn!  Understanding the internals of columnstore indexes allows querying to be even more efficient.

Columnstore indexes have evolved greatly since their introduction in SQL Server 2012.  This presentation explores this feature in SQL Server 2017 and SQL Server 2019 and how its newest features can turbo-charge your analytics workloads!

## Title: Need to Monitor Any Azure Resource? Must Learn Kusto Query Langua
 
**Abstract**:
Kusto is a service for storing and running interactive analytics over Big Data, easy to query using Kusto Query Language (KQL). As we make progress in our migration to the cloud, we are learning new ways to monitor and alert on resources and services. Microsoft has consolidated many services under the umbrella of ‘Azure Monitor.’ Whether you are ‘detecting and diagnose issues across applications,’ ‘correlate infrastructure issues for VMs,’ ‘drill into your SQL database monitoring data with Log Analytics,’ you will be using ‘Azure Monitor.’ Azure Monitor uses a version of the KQL that is suitable for simple log queries but also includes advanced functionality such as aggregations, joins, and smart analytics. Going forward, KQL is your only choice for querying the Azure Monitor log. 
In this 95% demo session, I will show you some ‘getting started’ tips and a few sophisticated queries using KQL. Come and learn about the future of monitoring and investigations of Azure services.

## Title: The search for Spark within the modern data platform.
 
**Abstract**:
The genesis project was supposed to terraform an empty planet into a livable environment. If you are a Star Trek fan, you might have seen this 1984 movie at the cinemas. However, similarities do exist with Databricks being able to transform cloud storage into a living data lake. 

Today’s talk will center on how the Databricks service makes it easy for the average developer to work with Apache Spark. A working knowledge of the Python language and Spark data frames is necessary to clean up and aggregate data in the lake. The introduction of the delta file format, has brought database ACID properties to the storage (file) system. Furthermore, the central hive metadata store allows developers to use Spark SQL to query the files like actual tables. Last but not least, a persistent cluster can be used as the data source for Power BI reporting. 

Attend this talk to learn how to create a modern data platform with the Azure Databricks service.

## Title: Data Time Travel with SQL Server Temporal Tables
 
**Abstract**:
Many times developers have to support users by answering the “What happened to the data?”  The task of retrieving data from a specific point in time is not an easy one.  Often this involves retrieving a backup and restoring the data in question (hopefully!).  SQL Server 2016 introduced Temporal Tables, allowing a developer to retrieve data from a specific point in time, without backups.  With a few TSQL commands a historical table can be created, automatically updated, and readily accessed.

## Title: Data Virtualization with PolyBase
 
**Abstract**:
PolyBase is Microsoft's data virtualization technology, allowing you to integrate SQL Server with external systems such as Hadoop and Azure Blob Storage.  As of SQL Server 2019, PolyBase also allows you to connect to diverse systems such as Oracle, MongoDB, Cosmos DB, Teradata, Apache Spark, and even other SQL Server instances.  In this talk, we will walk through the mechanics of PolyBase, showing how we can write T-SQL queries to access data from heterogeneous 

sources.  We will investigate the Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) and other resources needed to tease out what the PolyBase engine is doing behind the scenes and where to go when things break down.  Finally, we will look at several interesting use cases for PolyBase in the modern data environment.

## Title: Who's Pissing in Your Data Lake?
 
**Abstract**:
The new data terms of Data Lake, Data Reservoir, and Data Swamp have left me with more questions than answers. In this presentation, Karen discusses the types of data anomalies that organizations can run into when they use external data, the wrong datasets for the right reasons and the right datasets for the wrong reasons.  

These errors in design, oversights and old school, traditional practices can impact the success of your projects, even if you don't use any data lakes.

We'll look at end-to-end processes, data capture issues, impractical designs, balancing performance against data quality.  I'll be using examples from my own personal data to show you just how my data has been mistreated in IT systems.  Plus we'll talk about your data and your data stories.

We will build a list of good pracitices and tools to use to spare you from a flood of data issues in your organization.
