## Title: BI for the DBA - DeepDive
 
**Abstract**:
Business Intelligence requirements create a completely different workload to a traditional SQL implementation - both in terms of the load placed upon the infrastructure, as well as the load placed upon the database engine itself.

As BI adoption grows, DBAs are going to be expected to maintain and enhance both the BI infrastructure, and make sure that the databases support the requirements adequately. In this session, Mark will dive into the tradeoffs of various architectures for a BI platform, and work through the nuances of managing SSIS, SSAS and SSRS, both in terms of administering the instances, and also cover how a BI workload differs from an OLTP workload
