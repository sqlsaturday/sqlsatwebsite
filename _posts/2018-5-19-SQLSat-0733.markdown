## Title: Targeting Wait Statistics with Extended Events and DMVs
 
**Abstract**:
When troubleshooting overall server performance, wait statistics are a great place to start. But when your SQL Server hosts a complex set of workloads, it can be difficult to narrow down which queries are causing the most wait, and what types of wait they are causing. Fortunately, SQL Server provides easy ways for targeting which queries are causing you the most wait time. In this session, we’ll learn how to use both Extended Events, and Dynamic Management Views new to SQL Server 2016 for examining wait statistics at a query level, rather than at the server level. We’ll analyze poorly performing queries using a combination of methods and show how to quickly narrow down what SQL Server is waiting for, and why.

## Title: Whoa! Backup, what happened?
 
**Abstract**:
This session will start with performing a basic backup and restore of a database and then discuss the difference between FULL, Differential and Transaction backups. From there I will discuss many of the available options for backups, including backups of specific database files, to multiple files and different restore options.

Many DBAs still setup their backups via a GUI and “fire and forget” and don’t think about backups and restores until too late. This session will show you while that works in many cases, for larger or more complex databases, or databases with specialized HA requirements, the out of the box solution may be far from optimal.

## Title: Monitoring Linux Performance for the SQL Server Admin
 
**Abstract**:
So you’re a SQL Server administrator and you just installed SQL Server on Linux. It’s a whole new world. Don’t fear, it’s just an operating system. It has all the same components Windows has and in this session we’ll show you that. We will look at the Linux operating system architecture and show you where to look for the performance data you’re used to! Further we'll dive into SQLPAL and how it architecture and internals enables high performance for your SQL Server. By the end of this session you’ll be ready to go back to the office and have a solid understanding of performance monitoring Linux systems and SQL on Linux. We’ll look at the core system components of CPU, Disk, Memory and Networking monitoring techniques for each and look some of the new tools available including new DMVs and DBFS.

## Title: What You Need To Know About Processing Tabular Models
 
**Abstract**:
Ever wondered what's happening under the covers when processing a tabular model? Why is it such a resource intensive process? How can I make it run faster? Am I running into a resource bottleneck?

Processing an Analysis Services tabular model can be a very resource-intensive workload and depending on your specific goals (e.g. speed, availability, etc) it may not always be feasible to process the entire model.

In this session, you'll learn what actually happens and in what order during model processing, the difference between the various processing types, performance considerations and most common resource bottlenecks. We'll also cover the most common SSAS processing patterns and the tradeoffs of picking one over the other.

## Title: Well, actually...  How to not be THAT guy in IT
 
**Abstract**:
Unless you've been in a cave, you've seen articles lately on what it's like to be a woman in tech. In 2017, waves of blogs and news articles tell us about those extreme examples of misogyny. Only they aren't fringe, one-off stories.  It's happening to women you know.
IT can be an inhospitable place for women. Some call it a "bro-grammer" culture. Compared to men, women are leaving IT at 2.5x and are interrupted 3x as often. Our credentials are called into question.  We're called emotional or aggressive. We have our own job explained to us. Sometimes its subtle.  Other times it's overt. There's always that one guy who ruins it for the rest of you. 
It doesn't have to be that way.  Most of the guys we work with are stand-up, respectable WIT allies.  The problem is, you don't always notice when it happens.  Learn what those subtle forms of sexism look like at work.  Learn how you can stop that guy in his tracks.  Learn how to not BE that guy, even when you're just trying to help.

## Title: Intro to SQL Operations Studio
 
**Abstract**:
"SQL Operations Studio (preview) offers a modern, keyboard-focused T-SQL coding experience that makes your everyday tasks easier with built-in features, such as multiple tab windows, a rich T-SQL editor, IntelliSense, keyword completion, code snippets, code navigation, and source control integration (Git). Run on-demand T-SQL queries, view and save results as text, JSON, or Excel. Edit data, organize your favorite database connections, and browse database objects in a familiar object browsing experience."

And, it runs on a Mac (and Linux, and Windows, too). Similar to Visual Studio Code, SQL Operations Studio (still in pre-release form) lets you connect to and manipulate your databases without spinning up Visual Studio (or SSMS). We'll walk through how to get the bits and install them, then connect to and query a database (in Azure) - we might not even use a mouse! If time permits, we'll take a look at Code Snippets - a built-in capability to make your T-SQL coding super-productive!

## Title: Azure SQL Database for the Production DBA
 
**Abstract**:
Have you been wondering what Azure SQL Database is and what it means for you as a production DBA? Azure SQL Database has become an Enterprise-worthy database platform that provides relational database-as-a-service. In this session you’ll get a grounding in the fundamentals of  Azure SQL Database from a DBA perspective. First we’ll cover how to create an Azure SQL Database using the Azure Portal and an approach for sizing a new Azure SQL Database. Then we’ll cover some of the similarities and differences between on premises SQL Server and Azure SQL Database. Finally we will cover how monitoring and performance tuning Azure SQL Database differs from on premises SQL Server. If you’ve been considering Azure SQL Database for your organization, this session is for you!

## Title: Using Powershell to Document SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Most DBAs use multiple native and third party tools to fully document SQL Server instances yet still dont get all the objects. Even using Visual Studio and Database Projects, not all objects are exported because they live at the server level, above the database. Using Powershell, we will script out an organized set of files that can be checked into any Source Control system and or used for Disaster Recovery purposes. Objects exported include: SQL Agent Jobs/Alerts/Schedules, NT Service Credentials, SSIS-MSDB, SSIS-Catalog, SSAS Cubes, SSRS Reports, Logins, Server Configs, Linked Servers, DB Mail Operators/Accounts, Server Triggers and much more

## Title: Why am I able to master several technology languages but I struggle in my own business language?
 
**Abstract**:
Technology people are well known to be focused, results motivated, introvert, etc. 95% of your time is spent “communicating” successfully with computers: programming, building databases, analizing, etc. If something is wrong an alert window will pop up. The problem is that human interaction doesn’t have any warning sound to do it all over again or make some changes. Most of the time we only have one chance to do it right.
The struggles shows in a workplace filled with employees of different backgrounds or cultures, with different native languages that convey to speak English as the business language. Plus the fact that we don’t have the right skills to communicate appropriately. 
The problems will inevitably arise during human interaction; what we can do is try to minimize the frustration that it takes to communicate efficiently. In this session we will be able to learn that communication is not just a given fact, is something that needs to be learnt and taught.

## Title: "There Be Whales Here!" -- Big Data in SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Due to varying definitions of Big Data which confuse data volume and data organization, the common perception is that Big Data requires the use of Hadoop, MongoDB, or another NoSQL database.  SQL Server can easily store and manipulate very large volumes of data and perform quite well provided the database is properly set up and tuned.  In this session we'll cover some of the definitions and misconceptions of Big Data, look at some Big Data solutions that went horribly wrong and review a case where Big Data was successfully implemented in SQL Server.  Finally, we'll take a peek under the covers to see how SQL Server best handles Big Data through proper data models, table designs, performance tuning, and T-SQL techniques.

## Title: The Art and Science of Designing a Mission Critical SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
When asked to design a critical database system, too many people pick an HA feature and then design the solution around it. This usually results in a costly and disappointing design. 
This session will show you the five basic archetypes for mission critical database systems and how to select the right features from SQL Server to implement each design. Along the way you’ll hear some best practices, tips, and real world advice for choosing between features like Availability Groups and clustered instances of SQL Server, as well as the history of some of the more interesting and less often used availability features. You will also get a glimpse of how some of the largest mission critical systems running on the Microsoft platform are created using a distributed model where redundancy replaces failover.
While you may not be able to revisit your current designs right away, what you learn will improve how you approach thinking about making a system as fail-proof as it can be.

## Title: Dynamic Data Flows in SSIS without Programming
 
**Abstract**:
This session is an introduction to the unique functionality offered by COZYROC to create integration packages that dynamically map columns at runtime. The standard SSIS Data Flow Task can only use static metadata which is defined when the package is initially designed. The mapping of columns is configured and remains unchanged until the package is re-opened and design changes are made, thus costing maintenance time and effort. Data Flow Task Plus extends the capabilities of the standard Microsoft Data Flow task in that it allows you to set up dynamic data flows, thus eliminating maintenance time and effort. Changes to tables and columns are automatically incorporated at runtime without the need to change and redeploy the package. Columns and fields are mapped automatically at runtime. Furthermore, the initial design time and effort may be greatly reduced when dealing with huge amounts of data in a large number of files and/or databases.

## Title: Getting Git
 
**Abstract**:
Source control has been an integral part of the software development process for years.  For database development and administration many organizations still don’t use it, or struggle to integrate it into their process.  If have familiarity with source control systems if is most likely of the centralize variety such as Subversion or TFVC.  Git was first release in 2005 and has become the de facto standard for source control.  Unlike Subversion and TFVC it is a decentralized source control system and requires a different way to think about branching and how to integrate it into your development process.  
This session will cover:
•	Overview of Git
•	How it different from centralized source control systems
•	How to think in terms of Git
•	How to get started using Git with VSTS, SSMS and Visual Studio
•	Branching basics and pull requests
•	Tips, Tricks and Gotchas
•	Resources for learning Git and integrating it into your processes

## Title: SQL Server Recovery Fundamentals
 
**Abstract**:
Ever wonder what really breaks a log backup chain? Or are you intimidated by the idea of having to perform a page level restore? Backups and restores are the cornerstone of our work, but many data professionals do not fully understand them. Whether you are supporting transactional apps or building a data warehouse, mastering SQL Server recovery is a vital skill for our success. This session will take you behind the scenes of backups and restores, covering both the basics and some of the more nuanced details of SQL Server data protection. After this session, you will have a solid understanding of SQL Server recovery, allowing you to better configure, manage, and execute your own strategies.

## Title: Consumption Based Architecture
 
**Abstract**:
Is this a replacement for architectures out there today like Kimball, Inmon, Federated, etc? 
NO! It’s more about creating patterns and designs that focus on putting the data in the hands of the users by leveraging existing architectures.

All data assets, we really want to give our users a single source of the truth. We want them to go to one place to get all their data, that’s the common goal in enterprise data solutions. The problem is not all the data resides in one place, especially with big data, more tech savvy users, the vast amount of data resources available… you can really get data from anywhere. 

Promotes self-service by 
leveraging data assets you already have
increasing your business’ consumable data based on both need and data readiness. 

This is not a data dump but more about getting good data to the right business people at the right time.

## Title: How to Implement a Hierarchy in SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
One of the most common structures you will come across in the real world is a hierarchy (either a single parent "tree" or a multi-parent "graph"). Many systems will implement the obvious examples, such as a corporate managerial structure or a bill of materials. It turns out that almost any many-to-many relationship can be used as a hierarchy to find the relationship of parent rows to child rows (for example, the relationship of actors to movies they’ve been in). In this session, we’ll discuss several different implementations of hierarchies that you can use to optimize your hierarchy implementations, including SQL Server 2017's graph tables, and put into practice immediately, with ready-made T-SQL examples.

## Title: High Availability and Disaster Recovery: Too Many Choices!
 
**Abstract**:
Failover Clusters? Availability Groups? On-Prem or In The Cloud? Do it all with VMWare HA? Site to Site? Is log shipping even still an option? What about if we want to stay on Standard Edition?

So many questions revolve around High Availability and Disaster Recovery. They aren't just the "which way?" questions, though. In fact, those questions are the easy ones at the end of a process in sorting out which way to go. 

Let's spend an hour talking about RPOs, RTOs, SLAs and the businesses needs. Let's dissect why DR and HA are not the same and how to figure out how many 9s and how much horsepower or money you really need to throw at this problem.

We'll keep it good for beginners and intermediates. Come with questions about that HA/DR project on your desk. Leave with a better understanding of which options are ruled in or out, and why. We'll walk through a couple options in my lab, too.  We'll even talk about the cloud components available on this journey to availability.

## Title: Exploring SQL Server's Plan Cache
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server’s plan cache is one of the largest regions of memory and is used to store SQL and
T-SQL code for quick execution. It is largely self-maintaining and self-tuning. However, the kind of code
you write and the way you invoke that code can have an enormous impact on how the plan cache is
maintained, tuned, and optimized. If you don’t do things right, you could end up shooting yourself in the
foot and making performance much worse. Attend this demo-loaded session to learn about 4 harmful
anti-patterns that developers frequently use without knowing their drawbacks.
This session will answer questions like:
- What’s currently in the plan cache?
- How often is the code in my plan cache being reused?
- Where are the big opportunities to save space in the plan cache?
- What coding techniques are most likely to make my object recompile unnecessarily?
There are a short list of mistakes that, if you know of them in advance, will make your life much easier.

Microsoft Services includes: Vision (Computer Vision, Emotion, Face, Video), Speech/Language (Speaker Recognition, Spell, Sentiment, Language, Key Phrases, Topic detection, Linguistic Analysis), Knowledge, and Search. These services are consumed by using the Cognitive Services APIs. Power BI enables you to consume the APIs to enrich your unstructured data inside your Power BI solutions. During this session, we will cover how to consume the API using Power Query to then visualize the results with Power BI visuals. We will also consume the Cognitive services API by using a R script inside Power BI. This session is structured with a B2C Survey case study solution with a real time Dashboard using a streaming dataset.

## Title: Should You Use M or R for Data Wrangling in Power BI? It Depends.
 
**Abstract**:
Since the inception of Power BI, Power Query and the M programming language have been the main option that Power BI developers had to get data into the Power BI data model. In 2016 Microsoft gave us another option. They added the the ability to use the R programming language as a data source. 

R is a very popular statistical programming language that has some powerful “data wrangling” capabilities. In this session Patrick Leblanc and Ryan Wade will explore several data wrangling task in Power BI using both M and R. We will compare the two and show when it is best to use one over the other.
