## Title: A Game of Hierarchies: Introduction to Graph Processing with SQL
 
**Abstract**:
Hierarchies are the bread and butter of most business applications and you find them almost everywhere:
* Product Categories
* Sales Territories
* Bill of Material
* Calendar and Time
Even when there is a big need from a business perspective, the solutions in relational databases are mostly sort of awkward. The most flexible hierarchies are usually modeled as self-referenced tables. If you want to successfully query such self-referenced hierarchies, you will need either loops or recursive Common Table Expressions. SQL Server 2017 comes now with a different approach: Graph Database. 
Join this session for a journey through best practices to transform your hierarchies into useful information. We will have fun playing around with a sample database based on G. R. R. Martin’s famous “Game of Thrones”.

## Title: Get data insights faster with Data Wrangling
 
**Abstract**:
Self-Service Data Preparation aka Data Wrangling is becoming more and more popular in BigData and Enterprise world. Data Lake stores tons of different data and it is not easy to get value from it. Traditional approach doesn't work here, data analysts and data scientists have to wait until IT guys gather requirements and prepare a right dataset for them. Time from raw data to insights is too long. In this session, I invite you together look closer at Self-Service Data Prep and show how it would help to get insights and make decisions faster, onboard new data sources without IT, and increase efficiency for data analysts and data scientists.

## Title: Designing a SQL Server AlwaysOn Availability Groups Topology Without Losing Your Sanity
 
**Abstract**:
So, you’re tasked to implement SQL Server AlwaysOn Availability Groups but don’t know where to start. You have a lot of different topologies to choose from but they’re all the more confusing. Creating effective design architecture is key. In this session, we will look at the different topologies – from simple ones to advance – that you can implement and how to build them. At the end of the session, you will walk away with the knowledge on how to build the right SQL Server AlwaysOn Availability Group topology that will address your high availability and disaster recovery requirements.

You will learn:

- Common design patterns and guidelines that you need to consider when building your architecture
- Proper selection of quorum configuration
- Network configuration for local and geographically dispersed replicas
- Combining SQL Server Failover Clustering with AlwaysOn Availability Groups

## Title: IoT Circus –  deathmatch oops, datematch :) Power Bi vs Time Series Insights
 
**Abstract**:
Or how to visualize your data and find insights for beginner IoT developer
If you create an IoT solution today, you have a variety of components available to mix and match to make your solution, akin LEGO.
You get your hardware and firmware right and you get data from the sensors, now what? Of course, you would like to have, some data visualization easy and fast, and of course you would like to learn something from that data easy and fast. And it would be nice to have the results available on mobile devices, yes, yes easy and fast.
Now enter our two titan technologies in a match to the death oops data  trying to achieve these goals, you guess it easy fast (and cheap). 
And we will see them clash, from real hardware, to the big Azure cloud, to mobile devices, trying to outmatch each other.

## Title: Zombie Attack Against Clustered Indexes - Who really need them!
 
**Abstract**:
Clustered Index zombies come out of their graves to make the peace loving Heaps to one of them in your databases. Try to attack them or find a fair way to make them living together in peaceful harmony.

If you ask experts about using a clustered index you will in most cases hear the following statements: Yes, you need a narrow and contiguous clustered index for your table for good performance. Last but not least Microsoft Azure Databases requires clustered indexes but there might be situations when workloads and queries will suffer from wrong implemented clustered indexes.

Watch the demos which show in an impressive way that clustered indexes are not always the best choice. Build your clustered indexes wise or - as the demos will show - forgo for it for a better scaling. Become aware of the pros and cons of Clustered Indexes and make a wise decision when to use clustered indexes and the correct key attributes for it.

## Title: Rub DevOps on all the things!
 
**Abstract**:
What is DevOps and why should you rub it on anything?
In this session we'll explore, through demo's, how a DevOps mindset changed my personal way of working and development of database and BI solutions.
We'll shortly discuss what this actually means and in the demo's you'll see how to automate the deployment of your own databases, SSIS, SSRS and SSAS projects. On top of that, you'll experience the simple patterns and how to overcome blockers so you too can finally start to automate the deployment of just about anything.

## Title: Back to the future - Migrating our SQL Server OnPremise Database to Azure
 
**Abstract**:
We will cover the main aspects to migrate to one of the three architectures available in SQL Server in Azure from SQL Server On Premise. 

This session consists of:
-> What is the best platform for my environment? IaaS, PaaS, or SQL Datawarehouse.
-> Best Practices and best tools for our migration process depending on the platform chosen.
-> After the migration, we have several outstanding questions:
            Can I keep both environments synchronized?
             How is the performance of my database?

## Title: SQL Server vs. Windows Server - how to configure Windows for better SQL Server performance
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft SQL Server is running in Windows Server Operating system, however, most of the OS Administrators treats SQL Server just like another basic application. On the session, I will show how steps taken before actual installation of SQL Server can impact performance. The session is a walk through on all of the layers starting on hardware, virtualization (if used), Operating System and finally SQL Server. After the session, you will have set of best practices that can be applied to your environment.

## Title: Choosing the Right Database for Microservices Solutions
 
**Abstract**:
The past years have seen the explosive growth of large-scale distributed systems. This trend has changed the database world that is arguably without precedent in the history of the software industry. The result is a ompetitive database marketplace with a huge variety of platforms for us to choose from. But how do we go about making the right choices?

In this talk we will discuss how we can go about choosing the right database models for your application.  We will also look at how the choice of data models can help determine which technologies to include in your data tier.

## Title: Don't Use Cursors or Why You Maybe Should Use a Cursor After All
 
**Abstract**:
You might have heard "don't use cursors, they are slow!". In this presentation, you will learn that normally you should write set-based statements instead, and I will explain why they generally are faster. But I will also look at situations where using a loop for one reason or another is preferrable, and you will learn that the best way to run a loop in most cases is exactly a cursor, provided that it is implemented properly. I will also gives some tips how you can troubleshoot performance problems with loops and what pitfalls you need to avoid.

**Maryna Popova**
 
I am a Big Data Engineer in a BI team. I have around 4 years of  professional expertise in the Information Technologies industry, mainly all around data Engineering and Data Warehousing.
I am working on my 3rd BI Project now. All of them are in different business areas and are using different technologies. What is common between them is the  willingness to find the most proper development methodology as it is not a canonical development team and no development methodology works "out of the box" . 
In my talk I would like to share my experience in this area.
