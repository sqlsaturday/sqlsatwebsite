## Title: Think like the Cardinality Estimator
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server uses a phase during query optimization, called cardinality estimation (CE). This process makes estimates bases on the statistics as to how many rows flow from one query plan iterator to the next. Knowing how CE generates these numbers will enable you to write better TSQL code and, in turn, influence the type of physical operations during query execution. 

Based on that estimated rows, the query processor decides how to access an object, which physical join to use, how to sort the data. Do you know how the CE generates these numbers? What happens when you have multiple predicates, range predicates, variable values that are 'NOT KNOWN' to the optimizer, or you have predicate values increasing in ascending order? Do you know what will happen if your predicate is using a value that is outside of the histogram range?

In this session, I will show you how CE estimates in all these scenarios, and you will walk out better equipped to tackle those nasty, hard to solve query plans.

## Title: How to do a Complete SQL Server Assessment
 
**Abstract**:
Completing a full assessment on a SQL Server is essential to learning about not only the current state of the server, but also any area that may be impacting performance or security.  If you have more than one DBA, it is also important to have all the DBA team members review the same areas when completing an assessment.  During this session we will discuss when assessments are useful, what should be included in the assessment as well as how to interpret the results.  We will use a SQL script that will capture all the data needed.  This script will more than 88 data points, including fragmentation of indexes, performance counter values, server and database security information, queries that consume the most CPU time including execution plans as well as many other data points. This session will also cover how to document your findings and recommendations.

## Title: Mental Health and Wellness in IT: Safeguarding our most precious resource
 
**Abstract**:
One in four Americans suffers from a mental health challenge each year. In the tech community, this number rises to 42%. The stigma associated with discussions around mental health, as well as how it can negatively impact your work and home life, make people reluctant to discuss the topic. Now is the time to start discussing mental health in tech and how to take advantage of the opportunity to safeguard our most precious resource: people. We'll discuss how mental health affects job quality, including sharing examples from my professional life. We'll discuss the four primary workplace factors which play a pivotal role in mental health challenges in the tech community. I'll provide tips on what is best to say and not say to people you know whose lives are being affected by their mental health. Lastly, we'll cover how to make your workplace a safe place where mental health can be talked about and how to encourage your company to offer resources to help maintain everyone's mental health.

## Title: SQL Server Policies -  Underused Method for Configuring Your Database Server and Enforcing Standards
 
**Abstract**:
As a DBA for a financial clearing house and we are audited by multiple government regulators to 
make sure our database instances are configured to standards. When configuring an instance we have a checklist of configurations which must adhere to those standards. Then those configurations must be monitored to make sure they remain set according to those standards. This is time consuming, and labor intensive. If only there was a quick way to template those standards so that they could easily be applied and enforced to database instances. Well one way that can be done with SQL Server Policies !! SQL Server Policies can be used to both configure and enforce standards within a database instance. SQL Server Policies have been around since SQL Server 2008 , but have not gained much traction in the industry. SQL Server Policies been the "Rodney Dangerfield" of SQL Server features getting no respect. I'll show you how I used this feature to configure and enforce standards.

## Title: Azure Data Studio, SQL Server Containers, and You
 
**Abstract**:
Azure Data Studio (ADS) provides a cross-platform tool for SQL Server.  With ADS, you can manage connections, develop and execute code, and build and run Jupyter Notebooks.  Notebooks allow formatted text to be combined with executable code and can be render in a browser, making them ideal for wiki pages and runbooks.  With the November 2019 release, both T-SQL and PowerShell code can be executed in a notebook.  This allows docker commands to build and manage SQL Server containers from within a notebook.  Join me for this introduction to ADS and SQL Server containers.

## Title: Introduction to Extended Events
 
**Abstract**:
Extended Events have been available since 2008. At the time, there was a steep learning curve, and many folks decided to wait for a GUI. Even though a GUI was provided in 2012, many still depend on Profiler and Trace to understand what’s going on under the hood of SQL Server. 
During this session, you will learn how to make the transition to Extended Events. You’ll find out that it’s easier than you think!

## Title: Gathering Operational Data for Trending with PowerShell
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server has a very good store of data about your SQL Server operations that you can gather for trending. These include index usage, index operational, disk space, database space, etc. In this session you'll first learn the basics of what this data is and what it can be used for. Second you will see the solution I have developed to gather this information, as well as how you can modify it to get more data very simply. And last you will see some data I've gathered and reports that show you what your environment is like. You will learn how simple it is to get a wealth of information using my favorite tool (PowerShell) and hopefully it will become yours. If you are interested in operational insights into what is happening in your database and how simple it is to gather this data, this session is for you. You will get all demo scripts. This session is demo heavy so come hungry.

## Title: Navigating Row Level Security
 
**Abstract**:
New to SQL Server 2016 (okay, it's a few years old already, but it still feels new) is Row Level Security, which allows database developers and architects to effectively lock down tables, giving users access to a defined subset of data in the table.  It sounds easy enough, but there are a number of design considerations and pitfalls to be aware of.  This session will work through a few demos to implement RLS and dive into those pitfalls that need to be avoided.  For anyone considering implementing Row Level Security or have tried but have run into issues, this should be a session you want to attend.

## Title: Breaking Bad Habits: Solutions for Common Query Antipatterns
 
**Abstract**:
Your query returns the correct results, but even with supporting indexes it seems slow. Can it go any faster? In this session, we focus on T-SQL query antipatterns – commonly used techniques that are unintentionally counter-productive. Through an interactive story of user requests, we identify several antipatterns, examine what makes them troublesome, and show alternative methods to improve performance.

## Title: Infrastructure for the Data Professional: An Introduction
 
**Abstract**:
It doesn’t matter if you are a Junior DBA, an accidental DBA or all the way up to a Senior DBA, the infrastructure your SQL Server environment runs on is important.  Many among the DBA community came in as developers or perhaps directly into database administration roles it is equally possible that you have been out of the operations world long enough to have fallen out of the loop with what is happening.  This session is intended to provide a full stack infrastructure overview so that you can talk shop with your cohorts in operations to resolve issues and maybe even be proactive.  We will discuss, in an introductory fashion, hardware, network, storage, virtualization and operating system layers.  Additionally, some suggestions as to where to find more information will be provided.

## Title: Don't just code it—Generate It
 
**Abstract**:
Code Generators are all the rage—BIML, JS frameworks, .NET scaffolding, even the humble templates provide by SSMS for views, stored procedures, functions.
Table-driven applications allow one set of code to handle changing business needs. Metadata-driven code generation takes this a giant step further. If you can describe your code with an algorithm operating against a set of data, you can get a computer to produce the code.
 - Source to Target mapping documents can be used to generate the code to effect the mapping.
 - Service Broker activation stored procedures have a clearly defined structure. They can be mass-produced.
 - Standard CRUD stored procedures can be stamped out cookie-cutter fashion.
 - Business rules can be encoded in data and the code to implement them manufactured.
Generated code has systematic errors. Fix the errors at the generator. All the code now works. If the code is so boring that a computer can produce it, why not spend your talent doing something interesting?

## Title: The Curated Data Platform
 
**Abstract**:
The breadth of data platform options available to us today is staggering: between relational, object, graph, and document databases, we have a wide array of storage options, as well as a huge number of access and analysis tools. This talk will walk you through data platform, data analysis, and data processing options. We'll discuss when to use (and when not to use) Spark, R, Airflow, and Power BI, as well as a range of other interesting tools and technologies. By the end of this talk, you may not have MongoDB or Neo4J, but you will know where they might (or might not!) fit in your environment.

## Title: Window Functions in SQL
 
**Abstract**:
No, they don't have anything to do with the operating by the same name. Instead, window functions allow us to calculate a single value based on a set of rows, and we have extraordinary control over which rows get used as the inputs. We'll start by covering what a window function is and will discuss the syntax and usage of the OVER clause in detail.  We will also cover the three classes of window functions (ranking, aggregate and analytic) with focus on some commonly used functions as well some "gotchas" with some of these functions. You will learn how this class of functions can help you write more performant code.

## Title: 10 Cloudy Questions to Ask Before Migrating Your SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Cloud adoption of database-related services continues to accelerate, but the choices for which service to select – IaaS, DBaaS, and PaaS – all impact the features available to your applications. Selecting a service is a critical first step in the migration process, and selecting poorly can lead to cost overruns and significant time spent going down the wrong path. The questions you do not ask or consider prior to a migration can make or break your cloud experience. The most important ten questions to answer, such as your availability requirements, database-level dependencies, migration strategies, and other critical concerns, will all be discussed so that you are ready to move to the cloud with confidence to your platform of choice.

## Title: Intro to Query Store
 
**Abstract**:
In this session, we will look at the new Query Store feature in SQL Server 2016, 2017, and 2019.  Query Store tracks changes in execution plans, allowing you to easily view performance differences and revert to older plans with a few clicks of the mouse in 2016.

Then in 2017, Microsoft added wait stats per query plan and Automatic Plan Correction capabilities.  Allowing DBAs more tools to troubleshoot fires with and a way to automatically resolve issues.

In this session, we will walk through the features of the Query Store, so you can understand how to use them in SQL Server 2016, 2017, and 2019.
