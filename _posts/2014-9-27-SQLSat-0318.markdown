## Title: Turbocharge Your Career With a Learning Plan
 
**Abstract**:
What will you learn next quarter and why? How will you learn it? How much time and money will it cost? What is the ROI on learning those skills? Those are the questions that you answer by building a learning plan and, if you do it well, you’ll find yourself steadily pulling away from your peers.

It starts with a learning list, a place to capture skills you think you need to learn. That’s where you score each topic by estimating the effort to learn it in time and money and the value it adds to your career now and later. It’s absolutely an analog process, but it gives you the framework for answering one question: what do I learn next and why?

Once you’ve picked a topic, how do you learn more about it? Do you read blogs, buy books, or attend a class? Or all of the above? How much time makes sense? Join this session and learn how to dig into the topic to answer the questions that lead to a learning plan. After that, it’s just a matter of executing the plan!

## Title: How In-Memory Database Objects Affect Database Design
 
**Abstract**:
With SQL Server 2014, Microsoft has added a major new feature to help optimize OLTP database implementations by persisting your data primarily in RAM. Of course it isn't that simple, internally everything that uses this new feature is completely new. While the internals of this feature may be foreign to you, accessing the data that uses the structures very much resembles T-SQL as you already know it. As such, the first important question for the average developer will be how to adapt an existing application to make use of the technology to achieve enhanced performance. In this session, I will start with a normalized database, and adapt the logical and physical database model/implementation in several manners, performance testing the tables and code changes along the way.

## Title: Get Your Nights  Weekends Back from SQL Server Planned Downtime
 
**Abstract**:
Major disaster events resulting in unplanned downtime get all the press—but planned downtime constitutes almost 80% of the outages in any IT environment. This downtime is typically for tech refresh, migration projects, and OS/SQL Server patching. And when do you have to schedule the large downtime windows required to accomplish these upkeep tasks? Nights and weekends. Like you don't have better things to do then! In this session, learn how you can get in-place upgrades for OS and/or SQL Server as fast as SQL Server can stop  restart, no data migrations for tech refresh, low-impact break/fix, and planned downtime windows of less than 2 minutes.

## Title: Geekin’ Out on Extended Events -Deconstructing the system_health session to solve performance issues
 
**Abstract**:
Extended Events are used to gather a wide range of performance information to help troubleshoot performance problems in SQL Server. The system_health session is an Extended Events session that is included by default with SQL Server. This session starts automatically when the SQL Server database engine starts, and runs without any noticeable performance effects. This presentations will take you on an in-depth tour of the data provided in the system_health event session and how to use it to troubleshoot performance issues. Cases studies from real-life examples will be used to demonstrate tips and tricks.

## Title: Discover, Document,  Diagnose Your Servers on Your Lunch Break
 
**Abstract**:
Documentation is the bane of every DBA's existence. We all know we should do it but it's time consuming; by the time you're finally done it's probably out of date. Throw in the new servers you just found out about last week and keeping documentation up to date can turn into a full time job. And with everything we have to do in our day, who has time for that?

You need a way to work smarter, not harder, and automate your documentation. It can be done, and in this session you'll learn how to discover all the SQL Servers on your network, document their configuration from top to bottom (including OS details), and diagnose common problems before they turn into big headaches - all while you're out at lunch. You'll look like a rock star without writing a line of code on your own or having to ask management to sign a check.


Attend this session and walk away with everything you need to generate documentation for your entire SQL Server environment on your first day back at the office

## Title: Tired of the CRUD?  Automate it!
 
**Abstract**:
T4 templating support was added in the March 2014 release of SSDT.  This means we can now create a T4 template to automatically create CRUD procedures for all the tables in our database project.  Sure ORM tools like EF and nHibernate can handle CRUD operations in code, but if you want to provide an API to your database and avoid the tedious work of hand creating simple CRUD procedures this is the session for you!

After this session you will:

1. Understand the basics of T4 templating
2. Have a basic understanding of the Dac object model
3. Be able to create a script that will create 100's or even 1000's of CRUD procedures in seconds.

## Title: Database Development Comes out of the Dark Ages
 
**Abstract**:
Database development has traditionally been done using SQL Server Management Studio query window as the primary tool, when far more powerful tools are available in your toolset. This is the equivalent of writing a document using Notepad, when MS Word is available on your desktop. This session will take you through some of the basics of using SSDT, show you how to use VS2012 database projects effectively, how to utilize TFS build, test and deploy your code. I've had my share of bumps on the road to deploying these toolsets. At the end of this session you will have a good introduction into how to use the tools and how to avoid some common issues with legacy code you are already have in your environments.

## Title: Re-Indexing - The quest of ultimate automation
 
**Abstract**:
How many times you have been called on weekends to handle a nightmare caused by Re-Indexing job? One of the most common aspect of performance tuning is a well-design dynamic index optimization process. If you ever wonder what it takes to design an efficient re-indexing process, which do selective re-indexing, handles blocking efficiently, avoid system downtime due to log disk full, automatically stop itself beyond a threshold, can be implemented across all sql servers regardless of application type or data size, in other words, fewer headaches. This session is for you!!

In this session, Prakash will walk you through design considerations, accompanied with a script demo using PowerShell to generate a dynamic re-indexing script , created based on his real-life experience from managing high performing database systems.

## Title: Revenge: The SQL! - Director's Cut
 
**Abstract**:
Pop quiz DBA: Your developers are running rampant in production. Logic, reason, and threats have all failed. You're on the edge. What do you do? WHAT DO YOU DO?

Hint: You attend Revenge: The SQL! 

This session will show you how to "correct" all those bad practices. Everyone logging in as sa? Running huge cursors? Using SELECT * and ad-hoc SQL? Stop them dead, without actually killing them. Ever dropped a table, or database, or WHERE clause? You can prevent that! And if you’re tired of folks ignoring your naming conventions, make them behave with Unicode…and take your revenge!

Revenge: The SQL! is fun and educational and may even have some practical use, but you’ll want to attend simply to indulge your Dark Side. Revenge: The SQL! assumes no liability and is not available in all 50 states. Do not taunt Revenge: The SQL! or Happy Fun Ball.

## Title: How to Partition Anything!
 
**Abstract**:
Are you struggling with lots of data and really large tables? Have you heard of SQL Server Partitioning? Have you tried to figure out how you could add it to your database only to get lost in choosing the all-important Partition Key? Have you been told you can’t do that or had problems trying to figure out how you could use Partitioning on an OLTP database because the search criteria doesn't fit the Partition Key mold of a date Partition Key in the data warehouse examples that you may have seen. In this session I will describe a way that you can use partitioning on just about any table in any type of database. This system of Partitioning can not only bring query times down but it can also speed up the insert times on very large tables. Please come and let me provide you some useful information that you can immediately implement on your very large problem tables in your database and see immediate results.

## Title: SQL Security Best Practices  Shrinking Your Attack Surface
 
**Abstract**:
Every industry has a governing body or standard that requires some layer of security to your data.  In my travels I have come to realize that when someone mentions security, DBA's tend to get frightened.  This could be due to a lack of understanding of the requirements or not knowing what SQL Server offers to meet those requirements.  In this session we will go over what SQL Server has to offer, Security Best Practices and how you can shrink your attack surface to meet Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of your Servers and Data.
In addition, attending this talk is worth 1.5 Continuing Education credits.

## Title: Maintain SQL Server Performance Baseline with Powe
 
**Abstract**:
Maintaining a solid set of information about our servers and their performance is critical when issues arise, and often help us see a problem before it occurs.  Building a baseline of performance metrics allows us to know when something is wrong and help us to track it down and fix the problem.  This session will walk you through a series of PowerShell scripts you can schedule which will capture the most important data and a set of reports to show you how to use that data to keep your server running smoothly.

## Title: DataViz You Thought You Couldn't Do with SSRS
 
**Abstract**:
Despite SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) being a very flexible and adaptable tool when it comes to visualization techniques, very few venture beyond its ready-made charts. Most of the time, all it takes to build a chart considered “outside the scope” of SSRS is a bit of lateral thinking. Sometimes, we need to go a little further and use custom code. Join this session as we bust popular myths around "impossible in SSRS" visualizations and construct them live in SSRS!

## Title: Easy SQL Server Benchmarking
 
**Abstract**:
Do you have a new piece of hardware going into service and want to see how well it performs? Or do you have a few systems and want to see how they compare against each other? Multiple free and easy ways to stress test your SQL Servers exist by simulating an OLTP workload against a real SQL Server and the infrastructure underneath. In this session we will demonstrate how to test your storage and SQL Server instances to get raw performance numbers that you can use to compare performance of machines across your enterprise. The utilities DVDStore, HammerDB, and SQLIO will be demonstrated in depth.

## Title: Performance Tuning for Mere Mortals Part I
 
**Abstract**:
In this first part of a two part series, we look at performance tuning from the very beginning.  You're a new DBA, you want to be a DBA, or you've been declared an "Accidental DBA" and the phone rings. Someone tells you that they believe SQL Server is having a performance issue, what now?  The application is running slowly. Can you help them? Do you even know where to begin to help them?  In this session we'll cover how to handle performance tuning from the very beginning, when the user says "The database is slow."

## Title: Database Design Disasters: Common Mistakes Found in the Wild
 
**Abstract**:
Not every system has a database architect available to design it. But what happens when a database is created and the proper care wasn't taken into designing it? This session will take a real-world look into my experiences with some database design choices. We'll take a deep look into these design choices including a detailed discussion on why they didn't work and what could have been done better. We may even take a peek into SQL Server internals. This session is primarily for data professionals that are new to database design.

## Title: Making DBCC CHECKDB Go Faster
 
**Abstract**:
Along with backups, consistency checks are the two most important tasks that DBAs need to perform regularly. Our databases are getting bigger every day, and CHECKDB run times, along with its performance impact to Production systems, keep increasing. In this session we discuss how to improve your system so that you can reduce the time that it takes to run CHECKDB or the individual DBCC CHECK* commands. We will cover topics like DOP, tempdb configuration, trace flags, Resource Governor, and many more. In one of many the demos we will explore a real life example where SurveyMonkey's consistency checks were taken from 7 days down to 6 hours.

## Title: How To Kill SQL Server in 60 Minutes
 
**Abstract**:
It is easy to design a system that uses SQL Server as a database backend. However, designing a system that efficiently works under heavy load is a much more complicated task. You can encounter the same set of database design and code mistakes in almost every system implemented by a team of application developers.

This Power Point-free session is targeted to developer DBAs and developers. It shows the commonly encountered obvious and not-so-obvious database design and T-SQL code mistakes and demonstrates how to bring a perfectly healthy SQL Server to its knees in just 60 minutes.
