## Title: Paging DR Availability, Recovery Room STAT!
 
**Abstract**:
There are a lot of options when it comes to disaster recovery and high availability with regards to SQL Server. Most business owners (and many DBA's) lump disaster recovery (DR)  high availability (HA) together and while they do share some pieces, they call for different strategies. Do you pick one or more than one of these options, and what criteria do you use to make the choice? It’s incredibly important that you understand the decision tree that helps you pick the right options(s) for your business and that you can explain the choices clearly to the stakeholders. It’s not as complicated as it sounds, but it is complicated. This presentation will give you a high level understanding of the options, the costs, complexities,  reasons for t

## Title: Anti-patterns in Database design and T-Sql code
 
**Abstract**:
Simplicity and power of Microsoft SQL Server allows us to design and develop the working solution in virtually no time. Although there is a significant difference between the system that just works and the system that works efficiently. One of the challenges architects and developers often face is that the best practices and methods commonly used in the client development cannot be applied in the database world and rather hurt the systems than help them.

The session focuses on a few obvious and not-so-obvious anti-patterns commonly encountered in production database systems. It shows how to refactor them and improve the system performance.

## Title: Implementing auditing in SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
The ability to audit in SQL server has been available for quite some time using different tools and techniques. This session will outline several methods to implement audtiting, but will focus primarily on SQL Audit. SQL Audit provides the ability to track and log activities and changes at the instance or database level built upon Extended Events SQL Audit provides both synchronous and asynchronous capabilities. The granularity of events that can be monitored and tracked with SQL Audit can only be matched by means of using a SQL Profiler trace, but provides reduced overhead. This presentation will provide insight into the internals of SQL Audit, along with how to plan, create, and monitor instance and database level audits.

## Title: Data Late Than Never
 
**Abstract**:
How to Fill in the Gaps for Missing Data
When ETL lookups don’t match this can be a problem.  In the case of ETL processing over large data sets, having to figure out the missed match conditions for large numbers of rows can be a problem.  In the case of a dimensional warehouse, when you are processing large numbers of fact rows that have a lookup dependency, and you cannot get a match, what can you do?  We’ll discuss strategies such as 
1. Late Arriving Dimensions and Facts
2. Using a default values. 
2. Use multiple default values.
3. Creating a partially populated dimension row for a late arriving dimension.
4. Using “Level Of Confidence” pattern matching techniques

## Title: Data Sharding in OLTP Systems
 
**Abstract**:
One of the biggest challenges for modern OLTP Systems is the amount of data needed to be collected and processed. Business requirements, industry standards and regulations require systems to retain enormous amount of information. Offline data archiving is not often an option especially with the hosted solutions - customers expect old data to be available on the fly. Keeping all data in the single instance of SQL Server is the most expensive option from hardware cost and management standpoints. 

This session demonstrates several data sharding techniques that can be used to partition the data across multiple database servers focusing on the task of separating production and historical data in OLTP systems

**Abstract**:
This session takes you from using the PIVOT command with simple SQL databases to building simple cubes in Analysis Services with related tables.  After using this cube to create a pivot table in SSAS, I will show how the Office Power User can take the same SQL tables and connect to them from excel with PowerPivot to create similar Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts.

I have spent the last 16 years of my life living, learning and teaching SQL Server.  I am currently a Principal DBA at SAIC, and I teach online DBA courses at BYU-Idaho.   My life before all this was as a high school Drama teacher here in Florida.  It might seem an odd transition, but it really isn't.  To me, part of being a great DBA is embracing the artistry of the process.  How the design of a database ebbs and flows into its final form.  So, I guess you could say I am a SQL artist.

I have spent the last 16 years of my life living, learning and teaching SQL Server.  I am currently a Principal DBA at SAIC, and I teach online DBA courses at BYU-Idaho.   My life before all this was as a high school Drama teacher here in Florida.  It might seem an odd transition, but it really isn't.  To me, part of being a great DBA is embracing the artistry of the process.  How the design of a database ebbs and flows into its final form.  So, I guess you could say I am a SQL artist.
