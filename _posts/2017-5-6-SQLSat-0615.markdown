## Title: Public Preview of SQL Server on Linux
 
**Abstract**:
Abstract:

There was a lot of excitement at the Connect() developer conference in November 2016.  Two major announcements were made at the conference.

## Title: Database Project Makes Deployment Consistent
 
**Abstract**:
The deployment process is frustrating; an object is missing, an object is deployed in the wrong order or an incorrect version. Deploying to multiple environments like Dev, QA, UAT and Prod is a challenge whither on premise or in the cloud. Source controlling database objects is paramount. Team development is required. Database code will only be deployed when changed. Proper security deployment will be repeatable per environment. Together, let us discover how using Database Project will help us with consistent releases. Deployments can cause you trouble but we will share a reliable deployment and version control process. Let’s see how Database Project can help us accomplish this goal.

## Title: Tune Like a Guru!
 
**Abstract**:
In this Pre-Con event we will cover a wide array of topics that form the backbone of my SQL Server performance analysis and tuning work.  As a long-time relational engine consultant I have repeatedly found that the majority of clients I work with get amazing improvements by simply putting to use a fairly small collection of knowledge and tools.  We will cover many topics, including:
  
- Server, virtualization and database configuration
- Optimization processes
- Statistics
- Indexing
- Understanding query plans
- Improving design
- Improving code
- Profiler use and analysis
- Temp object usage
- Waits and IO stall analysis
- ORM Badness
 
We will look at all of these things and more from a variety of angles, while also covering many of the tips, tricks, tools, etc. I have collected in my almost 45,000 man hours of working with SQL Server.  I promise you will come away with lots of immediately-applicable information which you can take back to work and Tune Like A Guru!

## Title: Statistics  Cardinality – How They Work to Find Data Efficiently
 
**Abstract**:
Are your statistics up to date? 
Yes, it’s that dreaded phrase you hear all the time when it comes to performance tuning your SQL Server. What does it matter? Why should I care about statistics? Aren’t they automatic or something like that?
In this session we will go over why statistics matter, how they are generated, how they impact performance, and even how to maintain them. Once we have that all settled, we will take a quick look at how the cardinality estimator uses statistics to determine a ‘good enough’ plan to use. We will close out the session by taking a look at the performance impact from a simple upgrade of your SQL Server to 2014 and using the new cardinality estimator.

## Title: Disaster Documents: The role of documentation in disaster recovery
 
**Abstract**:
I was an employee of a company that had an office in the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001.  Prior to that infamous date, I had written several departmental documents that ended up being critical to our recovery.  In this presentation, I provide a narrative of what happened in the weeks following 9/11, and how documentation played a role in getting the organization back on its feet.

While other disaster recovery presentations talk about strategies, plans, and techniques, this presentation focuses on the documentation itself.  We will discuss the documents we had and how they were used in our recovery.  We will also discuss what documents we didn't have, and how they could have made the process better.

## Title: Efficient table design
 
**Abstract**:
The importance of proper table design cannot be underestimated. Misconceptions could lead into serious problems not only in terms of database performance, but also it can effect disk space management and interactivity of user interface as well. In this session the audience will have a sensible walk-through of database and table design in detail, encompassing a number of key areas of focus ranging from Data Types to FILESTREAM implementation. Discuss most common a table design mistakes. Find out efficiency of one type over another, IDENTITY vs. SEQUENCE vs. GUID to support PK uniqueness, pros and cons of using composite Primary Key and SPARSE column, and more.

## Title: Using Powershell to Document SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Most DBAs use multiple native and third party tools to fully document SQL Server instances yet still dont get all the objects. Even using Visual Studio and Database Projects, not all objects are exported because they live at the server level, above the database. Using Powershell, we will script out an organized set of files that can be checked into any Source Control system and or used for Disaster Recovery purposes. Objects exported include: SQL Agent Jobs/Alerts/Schedules, NT Service Credentials, SSIS-MSDB, SSIS-Catalog, SSAS Cubes, SSRS Reports, Logins, Server Configs, Linked Servers, DB Mail Operators/Accounts, Server Triggers and much more

## Title: Why candidates fail the job interview in the first minute
 
**Abstract**:
In the last two decades Thomas always had more open positions than I could fill, not because of lack of applicants, I must have interviewed close to 300 people for DBA, database developer, data architect, data modeling and other data related positions.

## Title: An (Advanced) Introduction to Power BI
 
**Abstract**:
When people talk about Power BI, it can be all sizzle and no steak. Instead, we are going to take a slightly deeper dive into the inner workings of PowerBI. We will cover the different components of the Power BI ecosystem: PowerQuery, DAX, Power BI visuals, Data gateways, and the Power BI service. Instead of just showing off pretty graphs, we will focus on a more fundamental understanding of these tools.

## Title: APPLY Yourself
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft introduced the APPLY operator in SQL Server 2005. This under-used, non-standard operator can help us solve a number of common (and not-so-common) problems with elegant code which performs well. We will look several problem spaces in which the APPLY operator shines, such as joining to table-valued functions, getting the top N child records for each parent record, string splitting, and word matching. With the use of these examples, we will gain a deeper understanding of when to use the APPLY operator.
