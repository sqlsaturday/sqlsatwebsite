## Title: Temporal Data in SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Databases that serve business applications should often support temporal data. For example, suppose a contract with a supplier is valid for a limited time only. It can be valid from a specific point in time onward, or it can be valid for a specific time interval—from a starting time point to an ending time point. In addition, many times you need to audit all changes in one or more tables. You might also need to be able to show the state in a specific point in time, or all changes made to a table in a specific period of time. From the data integrity perspective, you might need to implement many additional temporal specific constraints.
This session introduces the temporal problems, deals with solutions that go beyond SQL Server 2016 support, and shows out-of-the-box solution in SQL Server 2016, including:
•	Defining temporal data
•	Application versioned tables in SQL Server
•	System versioned tables in SQL Server 2016
•	What kind of temporal support is still missing

## Title: Exploring Dark Data with SQL Server 2016 and R
 
**Abstract**:
With the addition of R into SQL Server 2016, Microsoft have provided a few extra degrees of freedom for the standard SQL developer. You can now use the R language to wrangle, clean and collect external data, using libraries and functionality that simply wasn’t available to you before with regular T-SQL. Performing data enrichment at scale with SQL Server or even Microsoft R Server can provide extremely valuable new insights for your clients and start reaping the benefits of big data.

In this session, Consolidata’s Oliver Frost shows you how to develop your own application for tapping into ‘dark data’. Ollie will demonstrate how to stream live tweets, perform aggregations in R and pipe the output to a Power BI dashboard, giving you a full end-to-end experience of the importance of learning some basic R code in 2016. 

This session is for anyone who is new to R and is interested in expanding their skill set beyond their comfort zone in SQL Server.

## Title: Azure Machine learning beyond the basics with Juypter notebooks
 
**Abstract**:
Since the launch of Azure Machine Learning, there have been lots published on how to get started with AML. They look at basic regression, while regression is great, it only skims the surface of what machine learning is good at. In this session we go beyond the basics of regression and look at how we can clean and tune our model to boost its predictive performance. We will look at what you model is actually telling you and investigate how we can improve your accuracy. We will look at what algorithm works for what type of scenario, whether you're looking to predict, classify, recommend, cluster or segment. We will also look at why they work and what they are doing and how we can tweak their parameters to boost performance of our model. This is not Machine learning out of the box, this is applied machine learning. Is this session for you? Terms like supervised, unsupervised learning, confusion matrix, area under the curve should be familiar to you.

## Title: Columnstore killed the OLAP-Star?
 
**Abstract**:
With increasing speed in relational query execution classical analytical solutions get challenged more and more.
Why loose time for processing data into multi-dimensional databases? Why analyze outdated data if you can have fresh data instead?

We are analyzing typical scenarios from classical multi-dimensional analysis like YTD calculation, DistinctCount and others in regards to their efficiency with different solution approaches: Classical multi-dimensional databases in ROLAP mode, DirectQuery, T-SQL… And we are going to show how Columnstore indexes are influencing those solutions.

Find out about advantages and disadvantages of the different solutions in regards to the problem. And maybe you will discover new approaches for your own challenges.

## Title: Big Data - Big Quality?  A governance round-trip through the possibilities of the MS data platform
 
**Abstract**:
In the times of data explosion, a dazzling array of information streams and unbelievable possibilities of different techniques to manage data via the Microsoft Data Platform, this session asks the question: what about data curation? 
We dive into the requirements of modern data governance and curation and show in examples, what the Microsoft Data Platform has to offer: Can SQL Server Master Data Service (MDS), Data Quality Services (DQS) and Integration Service (SSIS) help? Which options offers the Azure Data Catalog and how does the Microsoft Common Data Service come into play? We also look at the potential of the new integrated languages in the Data Platform like R or U-SQL. At the end of this session you will have an overview and understanding of the possibilities, that Microsoft Data Platform offers you to address your data curation requirements.

## Title: Kerberos for SQL Server and SharePoint the easy way
 
**Abstract**:
Configuring Kerberos can be easy. Indeed, with favourable conditions and some preparation, the whole thing can be over in minutes. However, if hours later it still does not work, troubleshooting can take many days even with help of experts. 

What most resources usually cover is, at best, some step by step configuration instructions for a particular architecture. Such instructions often lack explanation of why it has to be done that way in terms of the role of every step in the authentication process.

I would like to present easy to follow principles of Kerberos constrained delegation and protocol transition with handy tips and templates to get this right the first time for your particular environment. The goal is to explain the meaning of the settings in terms of the role in the Kerberos constrained delegation authentication.

This presentation covers some very useful resources to help you tame your three-headed monster. I will also do a demo of configuration and troubleshooting

## Title: Analyzing the impact of weather on English Premier League matches in Power BI
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever wondered if there are more goals scored on a rainy day? This session shows how you can use open data sources and web pages to gather data. How you can then manipulate and extend it and finally report on it. We will look into how you can use data from open sources and combine it with data from web pages to create the dataset you need.  
When we have our dataset we will manipulate and extend it using M and DAX so that we can get meaningful insights from it. We will then dive into the data to see if there is anything to report.  

In this end to end Power BI Desktop demo we will use fun data that many can relate to as the English Premier League is one of the most popular football leagues in the world. The audience will take away many nuggets of information as they see how a real world example could look like. I will share all the obstacles and learning I got when creating this report reveiling both the limitation of Power BI Desktop and open data as well as its strength.

## Title: DevOps for BI Workshop Part I
 
**Abstract**:
This 2 hour charity minicon requires a separate registration and a small donation to charity. Registration and more details can be found through https://spssqldevops.eventbrite.co.uk

If you are releasing database changes, new reports, cubes or SSIS packages on a regular basis, you've probably offered up your share of blood, toil, tears and sweat on getting them delivered into production in working condition.
DevOps is a way to bridge the gap between developers and IT professionals and for that we need to address the toolchain to support the practices. Microsoft offers a set of tools that'll help you on your journey towards the end goal: Maximize predictability, efficiency, security and maintainability of operational processes.

We will in detail be looking at:

Agile Development Frame of Mind
	Visual Studio Online (tool)
	Feature/PBI/WI (concept)
Team Foundation Server
	Code Branching (concept)
	Build Agents (tool)
PowerShell
	Microsoft's "Glue" (tool)

## Title: Create Stunning Visualizations with The Help of R
 
**Abstract**:
R is the first choice for data scientists for a good reason: besides accessing and transforming data and applying statistical methods and models to it, it has a wide variety of possibilities to visualize data. As visual perception of data is the key to understanding data, this capability is crucial. This session will give you a broad overview over available packages and diagram types you can build with them on the one hand and a deep dive into common visualizations and their possibilities on the other hand. Impress yourself and your peers with stunning visualizations which will give you insights into data you could not achieve with other tools of Microsoft’s BI stack.

## Title: Scripting tabular models
 
**Abstract**:
Introducing the new scripting language for tabular models. Before SQL Server 2016 tabular models was wrapped into a multidimensional constructs. TOM is the new native library for tabular - this makes it easy to maintain, modify and deploy your model.

During this session I will go through and explain some examples and best practices on generating a SSAS tabular model by using the new TOM. I will spend some time showing and explaining a real world example on pushing measure creation and changes to the key business stakeholders and to ensure quick time to market.

The last thing i will show is how you speed up your development free up up to 50% of the time you spend building tabular models with the simple and advanced features of Tabular Editor 2.0

## Title: Real-Time Reporting through the medium of Dance
 
**Abstract**:
The modern data warehouse proposition has to deliver data at much greater velocities than we were previously able to. This is known as the speed layer in lambda architecture parlance.

But how do you start putting a real-time streaming dashboard together? For the first time, it's actually straightforward to achieve. This session will run through an example streaming application, taking live statistics from a dance-mat game through to a live dashboard. We'll go from scanning log files, pushing messages to an Event Hub, through Streaming Analytics into a live PowerBI Streaming Dashboard.

This demo-heavy, practical session will tell you all you need to know to get started with real-time reporting with Microsoft Azure.

## Title: Azure Data Factory  Creating Custom Activities Workshop part II
 
**Abstract**:
This 2 hour charity minicon requires a separate registration and a small donation to charity. Registration and more details can be found through https://spssqladf.eventbrite.co.uk

Having covered the basics in part 1 we’ll now go beyond the Azure Data Factory basic activity types and Azure Portal wizard. Extract and load are never the hard parts of the pipeline. It is the ability to transform, manipulate and clean our data that normally requires more effort. Sadly, this task doesn’t come so naturally to Azure Data Factory, as an orchestration tool so we need to rely on its custom activities to break out the C# to perform such tasks. Using Visual Studio, we’ll look at how to do exactly that and see what’s involved in Azure to utilise this pipeline extensibility feature. What handles the compute for the compiled .Net code and how can does this get deployed by ADF? Let’s learn how to fight back against those poorly formed CSV files and what we can do if Excel files are our only data sou

## Title: Effective Unit Testing for SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
There are tools available from Microsoft, as well as from a number of third party vendors, to ease the process of integrating database unit testing into your development environments and your continuous delivery pipeline.

This session isn't about any of those tools, but is an attempt to get back to basics - with the open source tSQLt framework - and address questions such as 

 Why is database unit testing difficult?
 What do I need to test?
 What do I not need to test?
What does a "good" unit test look like?
What tests should I be writing anwyay?

This session will incorporate real-life experiences with tSQLt, as well as lessons that can be learned from other testing framworks and other programming languages.

## Title: So you installed R, now what? A journey through the Tidyverse
 
**Abstract**:
By now, all the SQL world should have heard about the R language, especially
since Microsoft is committed to integrate it into their data platform products.

So you installed the R base system and the IDE of your choice. But it's like
buying a new car - nobody is content with the standard. You know there are
packages to get you started with analysis and visualization, but which ones?

A bundle called The Tidyverse comes in handy, consisting of packages mostly
(co-)authored by Hadley Wickham, one of the brightest minds in the R ecosystem.

We will take a look at the most popular Tidyverse ingredients like ggplot2,
dplyr and readr, and we'll have lots of code demos on real world examples.

I am currently working as a Data Engineer, improving the company data platform and providing the necessary resources for our data consultants. I am extremely fortunate to dabble with a number of tools including those from the Microsoft BI stack and NoSQL tech like Neo4j, R and Python. My strengths lie in integrating multiple technologies for a specific business problem.

I aim to present material that BI consultants and developers can all take away something new to apply to their own work processes. I try to apply knowledge and skills from my previous life as a neuroscientist and as a blindfolded Rubik's Cube world record holder. I am of the belief that, one day, neuroscience and big data will come together in a big way.
