## Title: Building a Database Deployment Pipeline
 
**Abstract**:
The pace of business accelerates fairly continuously and application development moves right with it. But we’re still trying to deploy databases the same way we did 10 years ago. This session addresses the need for changes in organizational structure, process and technology necessary to arrive at a nimble, fast, automatable and continuous database deployment process. We’ll use actual customer case studies to illustrate both the common methods and the unique context that led to a continuous delivery process that is best described as a pipeline. You will learn how to customize common practices and tool sets to build a database deployment pipeline unique to your environment in order to speed your own database delivery while still protecting your organization’s most valuable asset, it’s data.

## Title: Who Moved My Tuple--Columnstore Indexes in SQL Server 2014.
 
**Abstract**:

Data Warehouse workloads can be very large and taxing on your database server. With the modern demands of real-time analytics against growing volumes of data this challenge continues. When columnstore indexes and batch mode query processing were introduced in SQL Server 2012 were a performance game changer. In the 2012 implementation of columnstore, direct updating and inserting of data was not supported and other restrictions, such as data types limited the use of the feature. SQL 2014 removes those limitations—you can use a columnstore index as a clustered index, and more importantly directly perform DML against the index. Also, more query operators support batch mode, which means more of your queries can see performance benefits. You will understand the changes for 2014—and how having updateable columnstore indexes may cause changes to your process design. You will see the power of columnstore indexes in analytics, their limits, and how to include them into your system design.

## Title: Understanding Query Modes in Tabular Model
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Analysis Services Tabular Model allows rapid and simplified data modelling of Business Intelligence solutions. An important aspect that is often overlooked when building a tabular model, is meeting real-time requirements. In this session you will learn how to tackle immediate (or close to) real time requirements using the different types of Data Access and Query Modes of Tabular Model and how your choice impacts your reporting options in the Microsoft BI stack.

Using live demo, this session will outline advantages and disadvantages between DirectQuery and In-Memory modes. We will also highlight impersonation and partitioning differences between the two modes. Finally, we will also cover the definition of a Hybrid Tabular Model solution.

## Title: Top 10 Admininistrator Mistakes on SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server is easier to administrate than any other relational database on the market.  But “easier than everyone else” doesn’t mean it’s easy, nor does it mean is problem free. After all, many apps are growing from small, home-grown applications every year, with green IT professionals encountering issues that others had tackled and solved years ago.  Why not learn from those who first blazed the trails of database administration, so that we don’t make the same mistakes over and over again. There is a short list of mistakes that, if you know of them in advance, will make your life much easier. Once you apply the lessons learned from this session, you’ll find yourself performing at a higher level of efficiency and effectiveness than before.

## Title: Getting Started Reading Execution Plans
 
**Abstract**:
The best way to understand why your query is running slow is to look at the execution plan. But, knowing how to get started in execution plans, what to look for, what's important, can all be terribly confusing. This session will provide you with a simple set of tasks to get you started reading execution plans. You'll learn where to start, what to look for first, and you'll be better prepared to tune your queries. We'll also look at some methods you can use to write queries against the plans themselves in order to more easily and quickly identify potential issues within your plans. The information presented will be immediately applicable on the queries you have running back in the office.

## Title: Latches, Spinlocks, and Lock Free Data Structures
 
**Abstract**:
You know locking and blocking very well in SQL Server? You know how the isolation level influences locking? Perfect! Join me in this session to make a further deep dive into how SQL Server implements physical locking with lightweight synchronization objects like Latches and Spinlocks. We will cover the differences between both, and their use-cases in SQL Server. You will learn about best practices how to analyze and resolve Latch- and Spinlock contentation for your performance critical workload. At the end we will talk about lock free data structures, what they are, and how they are used by the new In-Memory OLTP technology that is part of SQL Server 2014.

## Title: Power Query in Modern Corporate BI
 
**Abstract**:
In a Corporate BI environment, it is common having data available in controlled data sources such as Data Warehouse, relational Data Marts, and Analysis Services cubes. Consuming this data with self-service BI is very useful, but how do you manage and validate the access to corporate data sources? How do you share and validate new queries created by end users? How can users extract data at the right granularity level? Power Query bridges the gap between corporate and self-service BI. It empowers end-users so that they can extract and manipulate data from several data sources, inside and outside of the company. In this session, learn the Power Query best practices that enable the extraction of data from existing database and cubes, guided by an expert who understands both worlds (Corporate BI and Power Pivot data models).

## Title: Improve your Database Performance in Seven Simple Steps
 
**Abstract**:
You wrote the code, you tested it, it works, and it’s fast. So you deploy. And then those pesky users insist on entering not hundreds, not thousands, but millions of rows – and suddenly, you have performance problems.
What to do? Blaming SQL Server is a good start, but won’t solve the problems. You can of course hire a database consultant to make all your performance problems (and all your money) disappear - but why not first take a look yourself?
This session will show you seven simple things, that might alleviate most of your database related performance problems. Use these tricks at your workplace, and you can be the hero of the department!

## Title: Load Testing With SQL Server Tools
 
**Abstract**:
It’s often difficult to know how your SQL Servers will perform under different loads. By performing load testing, we can gain these key insights, perform modifications to existing configurations, and understand the impact on performance levels.

Come learn about the native tools at our disposal for performing these important load tests and how we can identify when performance levels begin to drop. Using demos of these native tools – including Distributed Replay Utility (DRU), Database Tuning Adviser (DTA), Perfmon, Extended Events, and Profiler – we’ll see how to plan and perform a load test project, gain an understanding of SQL Server’s performance under varying load scenarios, and discover which tell-tale indicators can help alert us to performance degradation.

## Title: 1, 2, 3, … 100. How to manage many SQL Servers the easy way?
 
**Abstract**:
Quote: “A good DBA is a lazy DBA”. When you have to manage a few SQL Servers, it’s not that hard to be a lazy DBA and to automate your day to day activities. But when you have to manage over 100 instances, it can become a tough job. Just imagine how you will deploy a new maintenance job on all your instances? Are you going to connect to each server one by one? Not really… Microsoft provides an enhanced set of multi-server management tools. The purpose of this sessions is to point out which SQL Server tools you can use for multi-server management. The session is bulk loaded with demos and it will give you a good idea what features can be helpful in your environment.

## Title: Unlock the Power of Pivot Tables
 
**Abstract**:
Your tabular model is done, approved and ready to be used by the user. By means of using Excel the user gets very excited about the use of tabular Models. For a while the user uses Excel as a self-service business intelligence tool. Then all of a sudden the user starts asking if they can use the program to extract more and other information from the tabular model by the use of Excel. Now it is up to you to familiarize the user with all the possibilities of working with the tabular model by means of Excel.
Given the small amount of documented knowledge about the use of tabular models by means of Excel, I will show you how to get the best of your tabular models by using Excel as a self-service business intelligence tool. Filters, named sets, and calculations in the pivot table: I will explain it all!

## Title: Usage of R in SQL Server for better data understanding
 
**Abstract**:
Language R for Statistical computing is powerful language for data analysis with all great features for data import from SQL environment. Using R with SQL server data will help data scientists and data analysts prepare, explore and validate data much easier, as well as to use wide range of statistics; from uni-variate to multivariate.

Session will focus mainly on:
1) on connecting R Language with SQL server using standard ODBC connectors and T-SQL procedures. 
2) how to validate data with using classical statistical methods on SQL transactional data. 
3) how to use R output in SSRS and bring extra information to reports.

## Title:  SQL Server Deep Dive
 
**Abstract**:
How often do you wonder why SQL Server executes the query in such a way? Why is selecting few records from the table takes a long time? Why SQL Server eats lot of memory? etc. I invite you to join me in this session and look at the architectural components of SQL Server, look at the internal processes of SQL Server, and discuss how it affect performance of your queries.

## Title: A One Hour Data Analysts Toolkit: using R and PowerBI
 
**Abstract**:
If you want to conduct advanced Business Intelligence development and Business Analysis, then it is useful to understand data visualisation and have R as a tool in your toolset. In this intensive one hour session, we will look at the latest suite of Microsoft Business Intelligence tools - Microsoft Power BI in conjunction with R. The demos will be implemented in both tools in an end-to-end hour long session so that delegates can see when to use each technology in order to determine 'what to use' and 'when to use it', as well as seeing where the technologies complement each other. We will visualise the data according to data visualisation principles set out by Stephen Few amongst others.

## Title: Storage For the DBA
 
**Abstract**:
One of the biggest issues in database performance centers around storage.  It’s also one of the hardest places to troubleshoot performance issues because storage engineers and database administrators often do not speak the same language.  In this session, we’ll be looking at storage from both the database and storage perspectives.   We’ll be digging into LUNs, HBAs, the fabric, as well as RAID Groups.  In addition to theory, we’ll be looking at an actual EMC SAN so that we can translate what we see in the Storage Array with what we see on the actual server.

## Title: Advanced Indexing
 
**Abstract**:
So you know all about heaps, clustered indexes, and nonclustered indexes, but are still not satisfied? Then this is just the session for you!
Hugo will explore advanced features such as included columns, indexed views, and filtered indexes. You will find out how they are stored on disk, and how SQL Server uses them to satisfy queries. Then, you will see the tools SQL Server itself hands you to help identify just the right subset of indexes. And finally, you will get an stunning demonstration of just how bad you can hurt performance by following all those recommendations and creating too many indexes.

## Title: Troubleshooting TempDb
 
**Abstract**:
For most DBAs and DEVs the TempDb is a crystal ball. But the TempDb is the most critical component in a SQL Server installation and is used by your applications and also internally by SQL Server. TempDb is also one of the performance bottlenecks by design, because it is shared across the whole SQL Server instance. In this session we will take a closer look into the TempDb, how it is used by SQL Server, and how you can troubleshoot performance problems inside TempDb and how you can resolve them.

## Title: No more waiting – an introduction to SQL Server wait statistics
 
**Abstract**:
When you are standing in line at the grocery store you know exactly what you’re waiting for, paying the things you intend to buy. In SQL Server things aren’t usually so simple and many times you have to wait for more than only the length of the queue or the speed of the cashier. Thankfully SQL Server gathers the exact time you have been waiting and what resource you have been waiting on. In this session we will take a look at how SQL Server gathers this information and how it can help you identify, troubleshoot and proactively solve performance issues.

With over 10 years of experience with SQL Server my knowledge goes a long way. But there is always room for more. That's the reason why I love to help people face and solve their everyday or incidental challenges. This helps me to get more out of SQL Server. My main role is as a DBA but I love to hang around in Visual Studio and not afraid to take you up on a discussion about ADO.NET or the Entity Framework.
