## Title: Statistics 101: The Cost of Poor Cost Estimation
 
**Abstract**:
An entry level session regarding SQL Server statistics and the importance of their accuracy. The presentation will cover basic principles around what statistics are, how they are generated, and how the optimizer utilizes them (Cardinality Estimation). Will cover at a high level and provide examples regarding the histogram, string stats, and density in relation to their function in the estimation process. Will provide scenarios on how out of date stats can generate a bad plan and maintenance principals that can be applied to avoid bad plan generation. Finally, will provide a free set of code to automatically determine out of proportion stats for every database in a set of registered instances.

## Title: Introduction to Analysis Services
 
**Abstract**:
By now you have probably already heard about Analysis Services. Maybe you've even said to yourself that you were going to learn more about it but just haven't found the time. The biggest barrier to learning something new is figuring out the first few steps. But where do you begin? Come learn those first few steps by attending this presentation. We will discuss what Analysis Services is, where it shines and more importantly, how to get started.

## Title: Writing MDX in Reporting Services
 
**Abstract**:
Writing MDX can be a little intimidating and so most people that have to create an SSRS report against a cube will use the Query Designer. However, there are advantages to being able to write and craft your own MDX.

This session will walk the audience through writing MDX in Reporting Services versus using the Query Designer. During the session we will point out the good and the bad of each approach.

Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, data professionals of ALL ages, we welcome you to learn the basics of query plans and their operators.  This presentation will not only cure you of mental aches caused by the mysteries of estimated and actual row counts, but will also part the misty veil of physical join operators and aggregates.  When you leave this room, you will have the fundamental understanding of the language of query plans so that you can begin the wondrous process of query tuning.

## Title: SQL Server on VMWare,what a DBA should know
 
**Abstract**:
Many of our customers are either virtualizing databases or planning to do so soon. I hear from many groups that attempted running their database on VMware but went back to physical hardware because of performance issues. There are many reasons this may have happened, but quite often the decision to go back to physical was not based on hard facts. This presentation will explore the fundamentals of monitoring databases running in a VMware environment. If you are using classic O/S monitoring tools, you may be getting misleading data. Understand what metrics are important and how to get to that data.

## Title: Free Tools to Expand Your SQL Knowledge
 
**Abstract**:
Do you work by yourself each day and wonder what other SQL Server DBA's are doing?  

Have you ever come across a question and wished that you could ask a Microsoft employee or MVP but didn't know how?

Do you read SQL Server Magazine every month and find yourself thinking, there must be more information out there?  

Do you hear people talk about tweets and blogs and wonder what they're talking about, or stick your nose in the air and think - "that's not important"?

Let me show you how useful the various online knowledge and social networking tools can be to the beginner as well as to the expert DBA.

## Title: Managing and Auditing SQL Server Permissions
 
**Abstract**:
When your boss asks you who has access to your databases, do you break out into a cold sweat? Or, instead, are you worried about those other people who might have 'sa' access to your server and might be causing trouble on your server? Either way, as DBAs we need to be able to audit our SQL Server security. This presentation will give you a general overview of the different types of roles that you can use to manage access, what they mean, and how we look at the security gremlins hiding under the covers of our databases.

## Title: Asynchronous programming with Service Broker
 
**Abstract**:
In this session we will explore Service Broker, one of the lesser known features available since Microsoft SQL Server 2005.

We will look at a few examples of real world service broker implementations in OLTP as well as batch processing modes. We will also discuss some of the commonly used tools for troubleshooting a service broker set up, as well as some few to avoid common pitfalls.

## Title: Visualizing Your Indexes - Science vs Art
 
**Abstract**:
Indexes make queries run faster, right? Not always, no. And finding the right indexes for your needs is often more of an Art than a Science. Attend this session as we take a visual tour of how indexes are laid out and the way data is accessed when indexes are utilized. We will discuss clustered indexes as well as non-clustered indexes and also when to use indexed views along with some other variations.

## Title: Understanding SQL Server XML Features  
 
**Abstract**:
The XML Functionality embedded into SQL Server 2005 and 2008 is one of its most powerful yet least understood features.  This seems to be primarily because DBA's shy away from it and developers prefer to work with XML in their code.  In this session we will explore the XML features of SQL Server and how we can bridge these two worlds. Topics covered will include retrieving relational data as XML, storing XML in the database using the XML Datatype, XML indexes, and the XQuery functions included in SQL Server.  We will also look at using XML as stored procedure parameters as a way to pass large amounts of complex data between client and server.

## Title: I have been converted. Will you?
 
**Abstract**:
I am a database developer/dba like you and love using SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio) just like you.  But, since using the Visual Studio Database Edition tools, I am now a convert.  Visual Studio 2010 is the most recent released version of the database toolset and continues to greatly improve things providing database developers with the great tools that other developers have had for years.  We will cover deploying databases from VS 2010, Configuration Manager, handling Reference data, Pre  Post Deployment scripts, and touch on refactoring.   Come be converted =).

## Title: But it worked great in Dev!  Performance for Devs
 
**Abstract**:
If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.

## Title: User-Defined Aggregate Functions - Why and How
 
**Abstract**:
This session is all about SQL Server user-defined aggregate functions. We'll start with why you may want to use one even when alternative methods exist to get the same results. Then we'll walk through a simple yet useful example of creating an aggregate function, from start to finish. We'll create the .dll file in Visual Studio, enable the CLR in SSMS, import the aggregate and then put it to use. Along the way we'll cover some of the error messages you may receive, what they mean, and how to correct them. Come see what has been missing in your life without user-defined aggregate functions.

Hi, my name is Jason I'm a practice lead at Redapt. I spend most of my day helping clients solve business problems mostly in the Data and Advanced Analytics spaces. Sometimes this involves various and sundry cloud technologies including Azure Data Factory, Azure SQL Data Warehouse, Azure Data Lake Store, Azure Databricks, HDInsight and Azure SQL Database. I'm fluent in several languages including: SQL, C#, Python, and PowerShell.

I'm a Microsoft Certified Master of SQL Server (MCM) and have been recognized for my technical excellence and evangelism efforts by Microsoft by being awarded the Most Valuable Professional (MVP) for the last 5+ years.

In my off hours I like to snowboard, karaoke, ride roller coasters, and play arcade games
