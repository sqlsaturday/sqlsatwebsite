## Title: Dimensional Modeling Design Patterns: Beyond the Basics
 
**Abstract**:
Dimensional modeling is one of cornerstones of successful Business Intelligence initiatives. Even with new technologies like PowerPivot and Analysis Services Tabular models, you need to represent your organization’s data in a way that is accessible for end users and IT staff alike. An effective dimensional model will also ensure that your data warehouse or data mart will be responsive and capable of accommodating emerging requirements.
In this session, we will dive deeper into the art of dimensional modeling. We will look at how and when to create the different types of fact and dimension tables, Including patterns for enriching dimensional data, creating usable hierarchies for efficient navigation, and tracking historical changes. After attending this session you will be able to confidently assess the quality of your organization’s dimensional model and recommend and implement changes. Bring your toughest quandaries to help make this an interactive and engaging session.

## Title: Tools and Tips: From Accidental to Efficient Data Warehouse Developer
 
**Abstract**:
You have probably heard about the Accidental DBA, but what about the Accidental Data Warehouse developer? We stumbled into the world of data warehousing, learned dimensional modeling and work with T-SQL and SSIS daily. We are masters of googling solutions to our problems and make sure our ETL processes run without errors. We deliver data to business users... but we rarely deliver data as fast as we want.

You might not be able to rewrite your entire Data Warehouse or change your team's processes over night, but there are many things you can do to increase your own productivity and become a more efficient Data Warehouse developer.

In this session I will show you some of what I have learned and discovered that has made me exclaim "Oh wow! Why did I not know this yesterday!?" - including SSMS features, tools for query analysis and tuning, free tools and scripts, Biml for SSIS and even a couple of things I used to think were only useful for those scary DBAs.

## Title: Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere - Straight from the Source
 
**Abstract**:
Over the years, virtualization has matured from the exotic black magic realm to become a mainstream standard IT practice. "Virtualize First" is now a well-accepted default practice in most enterprises and any deviation is now considered an anomaly. In spite of this trend, many IT administrators and architects still have some reservations about virtualizing SQL Server workloads. They consider SQL too "critical" to be virtualized; they wonder and worry about scale about performance; they are looking for guidance and reassurance. If this is where you (or your clients) are today, be sure to attend this session. You will gain valuable insights from what others have done to successfully undertake similar tasks in their environments. We will talk about configuration pitfalls to avoid and also review the configuration and current performance data for some of the most demanding applications in customers environments. Got an SQL virtualization or performance question? Bring it!

## Title: Partitioning Basics: Treating Your Tables Like Legos
 
**Abstract**:
Do you have tables and indexes that have grown really large? Are you moving around a lot more data than you used to? Are your windows for jobs and maintenance getting tighter? If you answered yes to any of these questions, partitioning may be for you!

With partitioning, you can break a table or index down into smaller more manageable chunks. It can help you perform maintenance on just part of a table or index. You can even move data in and out of tables with quick and easy metadata only operations. We’ll go over basic partitioning concepts such as horizontal vs. vertical partitioning, and techniques like partitioned views and full blown table partitioning. We’ll  also look at how partitioning affects things under the hood. Finally you'll see some cool demos/tricks around index maintenance and data movement. At the end of this session you’ll have a firm understanding of how partitioning works and know how to make decisions on how and when to implement.

## Title: Biml for Beginners: Speed Up Your SSIS Development
 
**Abstract**:
Are you tired of creating and updating the same SSIS packages again and again? Is your wrist hurting from all that clicking, dragging, dropping, connecting and aligning? Do you want to take the next step and really speed up your SSIS development?

Say goodbye to repetitive work and hello to Biml, the markup language for Business Intelligence projects.

In this session we will look at the basics of Biml. First learn how to use Biml to generate SSIS packages from database metadata. Then see how you can reuse code to implement changes in multiple SSIS packages and projects with just a few clicks. Finally, we will create an example project that you can download and start with to speed up your SSIS development from day one.

Stop wasting your valuable time on doing the same things over and over and over again, and see how you can complete in a day what once took more than a week!

## Title: The Life Cycle of a Query in Virtual Reality
 
**Abstract**:
How would you like to learn about using Virtual Reality (VR) to present information? The ability to become immersed and walk around inside of a VR environment is a new and unique way to present and look at information. As data professionals we need to be open to novel displays of data and explore what VR can do that for us that we have not been able to do in the past. VR can provide a way for people to see relationships and interact among data sets which can be difficult for computers to display visually on a flat screen.

The Life Cycle of a Query in Virtual Reality is built using Epic Games video game engine called Unreal Engine 4 (UE4). With native support for VR, UE4 has been used for applications beyond just video games. With the commercial availability of affordable VR headsets, data professionals can now create visually compelling environments that were almost impossible or extremely expensive just a few years ago on both PC and mobile devices.

## Title: Life of a Lead DBA - How to explain to your boss 'what you do'
 
**Abstract**:
When you are a lead Database Administrator, you can almost be guaranteed that your boss will not know more about databases then you do.  

It will be your job to explain to your boss (customers, clients, etc.) what it takes to operate and maintain a well-running database environment.  You have to justify why there is work and spending necessary for *reactive* support and maintenance.  No organization can stand still, so you will also need to demonstrate the need for *proactive* work: research, training and planning for new architecture.  By doing so, you can demonstrate the value you are adding as a Lead DBA.

In this session, you will see some frameworks and templates for explaining your responsibilities to your boss.   Get some ideas reporting your workload in business terms, and presenting your database environment and concepts to non-technical audiences.

## Title: Consolidated Essential Performance Health Check using PowerShell
 
**Abstract**:
Standardizing essential performance health check is the key in responding quickly to production issues and can cut down initial evaluation phase to 1/3rd of the time, whether you have been requested to do health check or you may want to run these due to an alert. These sets of essential checks can be the first major checkpoint for a DBA, they can look quickly on consolidated email stats first to decide if any further action is required to fix an issue or is it feasible to jump into in-depth troubleshooting. This will cut down on time and effort while responding to Production issues.

First part of the email shares some key observations about SQL Server performance which can be the key to quick resolution of the issue. Rest of the email shows different set of stats regarding CPU/Disk IO/Disk Space/Memory/Network/Blocking and database performance which could lead to the slowness observed in the application. This consolidated email can be shared with technical stakeholders to give a snaps

## Title: Be Friendly to SQL Server with TSQL Best Practices
 
**Abstract**:
TSQL is a necessity when interacting with SQL Server so knowing can be half the battle. Performance is always good as the database starts to grow, but building in resilience when you begin is a greater advantage than refactoring. I will go over 5 key things to know when you write TSQL, use DataTypes and/or variables in comparisons and you will also learn about the procedure cache and how to avoid pitfalls there. This is a beginners session but the concepts in this session are a great foundation to begin with. If you are looking for a solid foundation to build on and need the basics to start, this session is definitely for you.

## Title: Introduction to Data Science with R
 
**Abstract**:
Data Science is the gaining popularity but what does it really mean? 
Discovering useful patterns and insight in the enterprise has become more challenging without a new set of tools. Big data has taken center stage in the data warehouse community and with data sets so large and complex that traditional data processing applications are becoming inadequate. Learn about the R language that is at the center of most advanced analytics conversations. R is an open source statistical language that is rapidly gaining popularity due to a robust set of machine learning functionality and a never-ending set of R packages that are used to increase functionality of the core R language.
In this session, we will introduce the R language and review some of the features of the highly interactive environment that are available with just the base install. We will also review some of the upcoming features in the SQL Server 2016.

## Title: Recovery Models Made SIMPLE
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server always logs every change to a database. But exactly what is logged can vary based on a number of factors. Some operations are referred to as "minimally logged," but even those operations can log a different level of detail depending on your recovery model. This session looks inside the transaction log to see exactly what is logged for minimally logged operations. First, we look at some background information regarding how the log is used and managed, and then we introduce a tool that can help you actually see your log records. When you can query the log, you can determine how logging for operations such as index rebuilds and SELECT INTO differs depending on whether you are using the FULL or BULK_LOGGED recovery model. We also look at other factors in our SQL Server operations that can affect what is actually written to the log. In addition, I’ll describe the benefits and caveats for each of the recovery models.

## Title: Who needs SSAS when you have SQL?
 
**Abstract**:
Analysis Services may seem foreign or unnecessary for SQL and .NET developers. However, it can offer many advantages for reporting and data exploration, even with the SQL engine's latest indexing and in-memory analytics capabilities. In this session, we will cover useful features of SSAS and discuss conditions where it is beneficial. Next we'll compare the two types of Analysis Services databases (Multidimensional and Tabular) and identify requirements that should influence your decision of which type is right for your solution. Then we will explore common ways to retrieve data and browse your SSAS database, such as Power BI and Excel, reporting tools like SSRS, and custom .NET applications.

## Title: Changing Your Habits to Improve the Performance of Your T-SQL
 
**Abstract**:
Do you dread handing your t-SQL over for code review? Do your queries run slower than you expect? Does the DBA always want to tweak your t-SQL? In this demo heavy session, we’ll take a look at various ways to improve your t-SQL. You’ll learn why top down design is not always the best pattern as well as why implicit conversions can slow down your queries. You’ll learn how to rewrite most cursors as well as finding out how user defined functions affect performance. You’ll learn some simple ways to troubleshoot these types of issues using execution plans and extended events. Finally we’ll take a look at how standards can help quicken turnaround time when refactoring t-SQL. By changing some of your t-SQL writing habits you can improve performance of queries from the very beginning.

## Title: Overcoming Chartaphobia with Power BI
 
**Abstract**:
Do reports in your organization consist mostly of giant tables of data? Perhaps you have gotten as far as adding KPI indicators or conditional highlighting to the tables. Maybe you have charts, but they are hideous and distracting. Although tables of data presented as reports are commonly found in many organizations, they may be doing you and your users a disservice. We'll discuss why cognitive psychological studies tell us that graphs and pictures are more effective at communicating trends and comparisons and how to prepare to create good data visualizations. Then we'll explore how to employ purposeful data viz designs to help users achieve their goal of making informed decisions, using a fun and useful Power BI dashboard. You'll leave with guidance on how to take boring or unreadable tables of data and turn them into useful and visually appealing reports.
