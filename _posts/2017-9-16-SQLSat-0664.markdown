## Title: 2,4,8  16 - Upgrade your journey with SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
2,4,8  16 - these aren't just numbers to count or calculate. These are years that how SQL Server evolved as number of years!

Why Upgrade? 
Data Platform Upgrade topic has been a popular session that I've presented in major conferences like Microsoft Tech-Ed (North America, Europe  India) and SQLbits since 2008. 

In this session, we will overview in depth end-to-end upgrade process that covers the essential phases, steps and issues involved in upgrading  SQL Server (2000 to  2012),  SQL Server 2014 (with a good overview on 2016 too) by using best practices and available resources. 

What to-do and what not-to-do?

A popular session that I have been presenting since the year 2008, in MS Tech-Ed, SQLSaturday  SQLbits UK.
We will cover the complete upgrade cycle, including the preparation tasks, upgrade tasks, and post-upgrade tasks. Real-world examples from my Consulting experience expanding on why  how such a solution.

## Title: SQL Server Performance Tuning Nowadays
 
**Abstract**:
Nothing is perfect, which means that your database may be not perfect as well. And one day you may decide that your database is slow and it's time to optimize it. But.. Where to start? When to end? What to look at? Which queries are slow? How to identify the real bottleneck? And so on, and so on. There are a lot of questions that should be answered in a process of performance tuning. 

In this session, we will find answers to all these questions going from collecting data for analysis, through identifying bottlenecks to optimization of the particular queries. On this way, we will learn performance tuning practical techniques and solve a bunch of issues in real-time. And despite I'm a big fan of Profiler and old-fashioned tools and technics, new, more interesting and useful instruments are available nowadays, so will use them to find the bottleneck and tune performance. Minimum of theory and a lot of practice.

## Title: Tuning large queries
 
**Abstract**:
Tuning large queries is going to show techniques and tools that allow to find optimizing solution when query plan is large. Multiple joins, function calls, many views and inline functions is what I call complex plan. In this short session I will try to tune large queries with multiple techniques.

**Abstract**:
How do the wait stats show you that you have a locking issue?
This session will show you how to detect and view blocking and lock waits, and understand the cause of it.
An extensive walkthrough of the different isolation levels and their respective benefits and drawbacks.
And finally a real-world quick list of suggestions on what you can do to solve some of the common issues I come across in my daily work.

## Title: SSIS – Transform Your Data in Parallel
 
**Abstract**:
There are few DWH environments out there which struggle with their data loading window and whole night is not enough for them to push all fresh data to those hungry star schemas. Since SQL Server 2016 we may speed up things by enabling new way of dealing with data processing – SSIS Scale Out. This full-of-demos session will show you how to set up workers, establish communication, split your workload among them in attempt to shorten execution times and where to find additional log files. This session will show you if parallel processing is the future of ETL in Microsoft world of data.

## Title: Reporting Services  Power BI Server
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft finally released Power BI Server - on-premise platform for Power BI solutions. 
During the session I’m going to explain licensing model and show how to use it. Finally, I’ll compare Power BI cloud service and on-premise capabilities.

## Title: Build your first bot – no code required!
 
**Abstract**:
Learn how to build a bot that will answer questions asked by users. Learn how to customise it and embed it on your website. Learn how to do all of this without having to write a single line of code.

I’ll be using Microsoft’s qnamaker.io site to build an FAQ bot and the putting it live with an Azure Bot Service and the Skype Web Control. The end result is a little snippet you can add to any web page, making implementation a breeze.

You can follow along as I build the bot live, or just soak it all in. Either way, you’ll see how easy it is to build a bot and you’ll know the next steps to follow to start building more complex bots.

## Title: R'em All. Use R in Power BI to Deal with Data
 
**Abstract**:
R becomes a commodity in Microsoft Data Platform, including Power BI as one of this platform's elements. By learning R data analysts and BI developers can significantly expand capabilities of Power BI, and perform much more sophisticated analysis. R can be used for getting data, for data transformations, for analysis with additional power of statistics and predictive algorithms, and finally for nontrivial visualizations. The purpose of this session is to showcase some step by step examples of how R code can be an integrated part of Power BI reports, as well as provide several scenarios in which R brings more power into Power BI.
