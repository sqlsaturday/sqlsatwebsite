## Title: Working with Temporal Data in SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
In many industries, it is necessary for data professionals to be able to show what a data set looked like at a previous point in time. Whether it's calculating tax or insurance rates based on a contract date, quickly comparing data changes over time for trend analysis or just recovering from an accidental data change, it's useful to be able to look back in time through our data. SQL Server has long offered solutions like Change Data Capture or trigger-based audit tables, though those aren’t always the best solutions for each situation. SQL Server 2016 introduces system-versioned tables, which track data through time with far less overhead than other solutions. In this session, you'll learn how to work with tables for each kind of solution, how SQL Server manages data within those tables, and how to query data at a specific point in time using several real-world examples. Attendees will leave with a fundamental understanding of practical use cases for different types of temporal tables.

## Title: PowerShell for BI Professionals: Automating SSIS, SSRS  SSAS
 
**Abstract**:
PowerShell has allowed DBAs to manage huge numbers of SQL servers, all automatically. Now BI practitioners can reap the same benefits of scale and automation.  Scenarios that are normally extremely time consuming can be done quickly, all with a few lines of PowerShell.  

This session will be filled with demos based on real-life scenarios and use-cases.  We will demonstrate how to scale and automate your BI solutions, with a minimum of effort.  In particular, we will be covering PowerShell cmdlets  their integrations with SSRS, SSIS,  SSAS.

By the end of the session, you'll be able to accomplish in minutes what would normally take hours or days.  You’ll know ways to quickly deploy hundreds of SSRS objects to multiple servers; or instantly identify and process stale SSAS dimensions.  Additionally, you will also be able to take care of some pesky ETL tasks, some by automating SSIS, and others using just plain old PowerShell.

## Title: Successfully Migrating Existing Databases to Azure SQL Database
 
**Abstract**:
First impressions have long-lasting effects. When dealing with an architecture change like migrating to Azure SQL Database the last thing you want to do is leave a bad first impression by having an unsuccessful migration. In this session, you will learn why Azure SQL Database might be for you. Next, you will learn how to test migrations for compatibility issues before you start the migration process. You will learn how to successfully migrate your database schema and data. Finally, you will learn how to determine which performance tier is a good starting point for your existing workload and how to monitor your workload over time to make sure your users have a great experience while you save as much money as possible.

## Title: How to Implement a Hierarchy in SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
One of the most common structures you will come across in the real world is a hierarchy (either a single parent "tree" or a multi-parent "graph"). Many systems will implement the obvious examples, such as a corporate managerial structure or a bill of materials. It turns out that almost any many-to-many relationship can be used as a hierarchy to find the relationship of parent rows to child rows (for example, the relationship of actors to movies they’ve been in). In this session, we’ll discuss several different implementations of hierarchies that you can use to optimize your hierarchy implementations, including SQL Server 2017's graph tables, and put into practice immediately, with ready-made T-SQL examples.

## Title: ETL Architecture for Real-Time BI
 
**Abstract**:
For decades batch processing has been the defacto standard for Extract Transform and Load.  For most of that time 24 hour data refresh cycles were accepted as part of Business Intelligence solutions and developer skill sets have long depended upon the reliable patterns of batch. In recent years, however, demands have begun to shift. New use cases in every industry are now causing leading edge BI solutions to demand much shorter time to realizing value. The old architecture, skills, and tools are proving insufficient to meet this demand. In this session we will look at the fundamentals of architecting real-time BI solutions, including the new categories of problems for which we will now have to solve.  Upon completing the session attendees will have a clear picture of the new skills and patterns that must be learned in order to excel in the next phase of Business Intelligence evolution.

## Title: DevOps for the DBA
 
**Abstract**:
DevOps came out of the Agile movement and the idea that operations needed to be part of the solution for agile development to be successful.  The DBA was often the most resilient and robust member of the operations team and most resistant to change.  This mentality was essential to the protection of company’s critical production data.

This session discusses common database challenges and how they can be minimized or solved with newer DevOps practices without impacting the DBAs “safe zone”.  We’ll discuss how to use these vital skills and motivate everyone towards solutions for more success in agile development environments. Development, testing, provisioning, patching, upgrading and managing will become easier with agile tools, virtualization and collaboration.  
The take-aways from this session are to embrace DevOps basics with a “DBA twist” such as:
•	Develop, Rinse, Repeat
•	Test Until Your Five Year Old Can Do It
•	Human Intervention Creates Human Error- Automate EVERYTHING.

## Title: Why am I able to master several technology languages but I struggle in my own business language?
 
**Abstract**:
Technology people are well known to be focused, results motivated, introvert, etc. 95% of your time is spent “communicating” successfully with computers: programming, building databases, analizing, etc. If something is wrong an alert window will pop up. The problem is that human interaction doesn’t have any warning sound to do it all over again or make some changes. Most of the time we only have one chance to do it right.
The struggles shows in a workplace filled with employees of different backgrounds or cultures, with different native languages that convey to speak English as the business language. Plus the fact that we don’t have the right skills to communicate appropriately. 
The problems will inevitably arise during human interaction; what we can do is try to minimize the frustration that it takes to communicate efficiently. In this session we will be able to learn that communication is not just a given fact, is something that needs to be learnt and taught.

## Title: End-to-End Troubleshooting Checklist for SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Learning how to detect, diagnose and resolve performance problems in SQL Server is tough.  Often, years are spent learning how to use the tools and techniques that help you detect when a problem is occurring, diagnose the root-cause of the problem, and then resolve the problem.  

In this session, attendees will see demonstrations of the tools and techniques which make difficult troubleshooting scenarios much faster and easier, including:

• XEvents, Profiler/Traces, and PerfMon 
• Using Dynamic Management Views (DMVs)
• Advanced Diagnostics Using Wait Stats
• Reading SQL Server execution plan 

Every DBA needs to know how to keep their SQL Server in tip-top condition, and you’ll need skills the covered in this session to do it.

## Title: Automate your SQL Server installs and configurations using Powershell Desired State Configuration
 
**Abstract**:
Database administrators are being tasked with managing a large number of SQL Server instances.  These instances can be built on premise, virtualized, physical, or in the cloud.  With Powershell Desired State Configuration, DBAs can not only automate the installation of SQL Server, but also any specific configurations needing to be applied to each new instance.  Powershell DSC provides a repeatable process to ensure all builds are done in the exact same way.  We'll cover what is Powershell Desired State Configuration and how a DBA can take advantage of it.  Next, we'll dive straight into a demo of the installation and configuration of two SQL Server instances from scratch.  

Some powershell experience is recommended.

## Title: Reducing The Surface Area Of Risk in Data Security
 
**Abstract**:
Data obfuscation, also known as data masking, is soon a new legal requirement. Masking is the solution for non-production systems (i.e. DEV, TEST, etc) to greatly reduce the surface area of risk for data breach in your organization.  Masking should not be confused with encryption, which is an appropriate solution for production applications.  Those who believe that encryption solves all security problems are misled.

When done properly, masked data is not noticeable unless you look closely. Masking data well might still be usable for analytic reporting and aggregation, yet utterly useless for revealing confidential data. Masking is important enough that sophisticated software packages have become available.

Come learn about the right way to mask non-production data in order to allow the organization to limit possible exposure only to production.  Learn what techniques can be used, why, and what factors should be considered when deciding to secure confidential data.

## Title: SQL Server Take Over:  Establishing a Baseline
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Take Over:  Establishing a Baseline

Performance assessment and tuning for the beginner DBA
 
Have you ever inherited a group of servers with not a lot of documentation to accompany them?   Do you have a lot of undocumented or new servers in your environment and you want to establish some baseline configuration setting prior to making changes? You need up to date information on the system very quickly. 
 
The server is running slowly... or is it? Slow compared to what?  Before you being digging into performance issues, there are some baseline metrics you should have established. Only after the information has been gathered, can a plan of attack be developed to help resolve issues with performance. Attendees in this session will learn how to quickly  gather information, review the results and get an action plan on the next step in performance tuning.

## Title: How to Build Your Disaster Recovery Plan
 
**Abstract**:
So your boss asked for a copy of your DR plan.  Once you've wiped that deer-in-the-headlights look off your face, you realize "We've got database backups," isn't exactly a plan.  You need to come up with a plan to recover your business when disaster strikes. This session will help you build this plan by defining what a disaster could be, documenting the business impact, and identifying your limitations.  We will show how to use this information to establish metrics (such as RTO and RPO), document current recovery configurations, and design an effective recovery strategy that meets the needs and budget of your business. Attending this session will give you the knowledge and tools to create an effective disaster recovery plan that will make your boss happy and ensure the continuity of your business.

## Title: Tame Your Unruly Data With Constraints
 
**Abstract**:
Bad data comes in many forms: duplicate rows, wrong data type, invalid values, and orphaned or missing foreign keys. Time is wasted cleansing, reviewing and correcting data, not to mention the potential hazards bad data can cause. This introductory presentation will explain the data types and constraints available in SQL Server, and how they can replace or augment business rules that would otherwise be written in application or procedure code. Performance benefits provided by constraints will be demonstrated. We will examine the various system views and procedures that describe constraints and how to use them to document your databases. You will be able to apply this knowledge to your database environments and see significant improvements in data quality, performance, and reliability.

## Title: Why Third Party Vendors Do The Things They Do
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever installed a third-party application that uses SQL Server, started to use it, and then wondered why does this feature behave this way or what the heck were they thinking when they did it this way.

I at one point was one of those people who designed, developed, and maintained databases for an ISV.  This is my chance to explain and atone for my database sins and explain why some decisions seem like good ideas at the time and why some are forced upon an ISV.

This presentation has three main objectives:
 1) Explain why vendors make the design, coding, and implementation decisions that they do; 
2) Discuss how to make third-party applications run better in your environment; 
3) Teach you how to work around those limitations and work with those vendors and get better support.

## Title: Twitter Data  Sentiment Analysis: Staring Logic Apps, Azure ML, Twitter Data, Power BI, and Python
 
**Abstract**:
Six months ago we went to Spider-man: Homecoming.  On the way home I thought “I wonder what the rest of the world thinks of this movie?  I wonder what people on Twitter are saying?  I wonder if this is that tied to box office performance?”  Over the last six months we’ve been building data sets on movies and collecting sentiment analysis of Twitter data.  This lead to a journey of data discovery.  First to figure out how to capture and analyze social media data from Twitter.  Next we needed box office information.  After that we wanted to capture sentiment.  Then we wanted stock market data.  Then we wanted movie information, runtime, rating, Metacritic score, IMDB score, and then how do we get historical data if we want to increase our data set?  Once you collect the data how do you store it?  How do you display it?  All this and more….. but probably just this….because that’s a lot.

## Title: Reading Execution Plans Successfully
 
**Abstract**:
If you've seen an execution plan but didn't know how to read it, this session is for you.

The goal of this session to learn how SQL Server is interpreting your query into an execution plan. We'll discuss execution plan internals, how SQL Server estimates the cost of your query, and what a graphical execution plan is displaying through its operators.

Learning to read an execution plan is a great way to begin troubleshooting performance. At the end, we will take a look at how SQL Server 2016 provides more tools for exploring execution plans.

## Title: Where Should My Data Live (and Why)?
 
**Abstract**:
Long gone are the days where the only architecture decision you had to make when scaling an environment was deciding which part of the datacenter would store your new server. There is a dizzying array of options available in the SQL Server and Azure ecosystems and those are evolving by the day. Is “the cloud” a fad? Are private datacenters a thing of the past? Could both questions have a kernel of truth in them? In this session I will go over real world scenarios and walk you through real world solutions that utilize your datacenter, cloud providers, and everything in between to keep your data highly available and your customers happy.
