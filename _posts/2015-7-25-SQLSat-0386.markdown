## Title: Getting Started with MDX
 
**Abstract**:
In this session, led by Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson, we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.   This session applies equally to Analysis Services 2008, 2008R2 and 2012.

## Title: Introducing Forensic Analytics with PowerPivot for Excel
 
**Abstract**:
Despite the wealth of analytical technologies available today, 65% of fraud at public companies is detected through tips, management review, or simple accidents.  Forensic Analytics combine human intuition and leading-edge technologies, and can provide superior detection methods to significantly improve the detection and investigation of illegal or unethical activities.
In this session, we explore Forensic Analytics: a set of techniques we can use to uncover irregularities in financial data. We also gain an understanding of goals of Forensic Analytics: to enable us to find out how — and why — these irregularities exist, and to find out their source(s) — especially when fraudulent activity is suspected.  We discuss guiding principles that are key to isolating data anomalies, and outline a standard, repeatable process to Forensic Analytics. Throughout the session, we view examples of how we can employ PowerPivot for Excel to drive Forensic Analytics via various tests and reviews.

## Title: What Every DBA Needs To Know About Storage For SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Do you have issues communicating your needs to your Storage/SAN Administrator? Do they seem to speak a different language when it comes to determining and providing your SQL Server storage needs?  In this session we'll review storage technologies so that you can communicate effectively with your Storage/SAN Administrator as well as methods of monitoring your storage to ensure that your needs are met.
In this session we will discuss RAID types, Local/Direct Attached Storage vs SAN Storage, and Flash Storage (including how it fits into multiple storage models).  We'll also review methods for monitoring and testing your storage performance.  With the information gathered in this session, you'll be able to have thorough, informed discussions with your Storage Administrator as well as being able to provide solid metrics to confirm storage performance.

## Title: Introduction to SQL Server Automation with PowerShell
 
**Abstract**:
DBA’s are constantly faced with challenges in maintaining a healthy SQL Server environment. Monitoring our database servers, deploying database code changes and performing database restores are just a few examples of a day in the life of a DBA. As workloads increase, performing these tasks manually introduces more opportunity for human error and time starts to become your bottleneck. Your only option if you want to stay above water is to become more efficient at what you do. Enter, automation. 

Using PowerShell with the SQLPS module is a very potent combination for DBA’s looking to automate their database environment. This presentation will give you an overview of the PowerShell language itself, and then it will dive a bit deeper into the SQLPS module for SQL Server. Be it large or small, there are plenty of opportunities for leveraging PowerShell and SQLPS to help you automate your environment. 

The sooner you start to learn the better, because PowerShell is here to stay.

## Title: Bulletproof SSIS - A new process control framework
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever had a package fail and wish it would recover automatically?  Have you ever encountered a source or network issue and loaded bad or incomplete data into production?  Do you have jobs that fail or load bad data because an upstream dependency ran long?  Do you need faster loads to stay within your load window?

Some of the common challenges facing SSIS developers and DBAs are scaling up and/or out to increase throughput, load balancing, recoverability and restartability, basic process auditing, and multiple job dependency checking.  This presentation reviews all of the elements to building a process control framework using the work pile design pattern that can help resolve many of these issues.  Finally we will conclude with a demonstration of a basic process control framework outlining table design, control packages, load packages, dependency checks, audit controls, and very basic load balancing.  Downloads include: slide deck, table scripts, SSIS packages.

## Title: Unleashing SSIS with expressions, configurable properties, and parameters
 
**Abstract**:
 Have you struggled to build SSIS packages?  You are starting to get the hang of it, but many things more than basic data movement remain a frustrating challenge.  The SSIS expression language is an incredible source of power within SSIS but a profound challenge to many.  Another area of power and flexibility in SSIS is its very broadly scoped configurability.  This presentation will walk through the basics of the SSIS expression language including the whys and wherefores of a few expression peculiarities.  Then we will review how you can use those expressions to configure so many of the properties in SSIS that you might barely recognize what your package can do when you are finished.  Finally we will review input parameters and how to further influence the behavior of your packages at run time.  Download includes slide deck, expression samples, and some packages.

## Title: 101 Stupid Things Your Colleagues Do When Setting Up A SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
There are some things that you just wish your colleagues had known before they set up and installed SQL Server.  A successful installation of SQL Server requires more than someone accepting all the default options or clicking Next a bunch of times; proper choices need to be made.  In this session you'll learn from the mistakes of others as well as best-practice configurations across the entire infrastructure stack (Physical server, storage, virtualization, OS, and SQL Server layers) in order to ensure stable performance.  This session is for the accidental DBA or anyone who needs to install SQL Server occasionally (or for their colleagues who need to mop up afterwards).

## Title: SQL Server Compression - Getting More Out of Less
 
**Abstract**:
We are storing more information then we ever have before and we need to retain this information for longer periods of time. Do we keep adding more and more disk space? What about performance? What about cost? Is there some way we can use the existing space more efficiently? With data compression we can tackle these issues and do it with minimal or even no changes to our existing code.

## Title: Location Location Location Preparing and Presenting Geographic Data 
 
**Abstract**:
This session will begin with the tasks necessary to model a dimensional data structure to maintain and present geographic data.  We will discuss various requirements that can affect a data model such as granularity, surrogate keys, slowly changing dimensions.  Real life examples and solutions will provided to give better context to each step in the process.
After the data structure has been created we will focus on how to best “clean” and validate the geographic data.  We will focus on using SSIS to obtain latitude and longitude and then how this can be converted SQL Server spatial types.
Finally we will cover presenting this data using SSRS and Power Map and how to create dynamic and aesthetically pleasing graphical reports.  This portion of the session concentrates on presenting reports using the geographic data type that answer specific questions such as:
Events that occurred at a specific address, zip code, and even block range and events within a mile radius.

## Title: Advanced Programming in PowerShell
 
**Abstract**:
PowerShell is the hottest new Microsoft technology and you need to know it.  Assuming a basic knowledge of PowerShell, this session will focus on advanced topics like creating modules, advanced functions, creating custom PowerShell objects, creating a GUI for your scripts, application automation and  much more.  Many code examples will be examined to show you how to apply the concepts. This is the presentation to attend to step up your game.

## Title: Accounting Basics for Database Developers
 
**Abstract**:
Many database developers sooner or later need to consume from or feed data to an accounting application such as the 
General Ledger.  Not being trained as bookkeepers, we may find bookkeeping conventions confusing at best and mystical at 
worst.  When is a credit negative, and a debit positive ?  The subject also has a reputation for being dull.  

But not really understanding the concepts and semantics seriously impedes unit testing, effective communication with the business, and  excessive dependence on business analysts as intermediaries.  We can do better !  This session will focus on demystifying the concepts and terms of basic accounting, facilitating further study if you are so inclined and enabling you to understand the requirements and be proactive in testing.  

The session will conclude with a brief demo showing how SQL Server's Analysis Services directly supports some bookkeeping concepts.

## Title: So you think you know SSIS? What about Scripting? 
 
**Abstract**:
If you don’t know how to extend the power of SSIS through the Script Task and Script Component, you don’t know SSIS.  Empower your SSIS skills by learning how to add  .Net scripts to your packages using C# or VB.Net code to access the full power of Windows and its object models.  In this presentation Bryan will walk through the basics of SSIS scripting building to more complex examples using real world cases.  Learn how to load any external flat file by taking direct control, how to leverage the power of the SQL Server Object Model (SMO), ActiveX Data Objects (ADO.Net), and use the power of Regular Expressions for advanced string parsing.  You will leave with the basics you need to start scripting and a number of useful scripts you can add to your packages.

## Title: Hacking Expos#233; - Using SSL to Secure SQL Server Connections
 
**Abstract**:
You know all the ways to protect your database when it is at rest, but what about when someone connects and starts running some queries? What if they connect and don't do anything? Just how exposed is that data? 
We will assume the role of a hacker and, by using a simple technique, we will sniff packets on a network to reveal what data is being sent. You may be shocked! 
We will then secure our database connections with a simple self-signed SSL certificate. 
Once secured, we will resume the role of the hacker and look inside the packets to see what has changed. 
*Warning - Do not try these demos at work without proper permissions as actual hacking techniques are used.

## Title: Software testing automation myths and CI
 
**Abstract**:
Even though functional testing has been around for several years people still make assumptions which lead to major blunders. I am sure many of software engineers have heard a question, 'why manually test, when it can be replaced by automation tests?'. This assumption leads to major blunders in test automation. We will go through few of test automation assumptions and how many assume automation is a silver bullet. We will talk about how to achieve efficient and valuable test automation.
We will also go through, how to incorporate Continuous Integration into testing automation to achieve Continuous Delivery.

## Title: Tracking Index Usage in SQL 2012 and SQL 2014
 
**Abstract**:
An important function in the role of DBA is one of Index Maintenance. This includes not only evaluating what indexes we should have, but also what indexes we do have, but don't really need. Since database usage patterns change over time, indexes that were needed once might not be needed now.

But I'm not really going to talk much about that. :)

In order to evaluate index usage, we need to have some way of gathering and storing index usage information over time. Unfortunately, many of the standard solutions are falling short. Why? You better come to the presentation and find out.

## Title: Optimizing Protected Indexes
 
**Abstract**:
As a SQL Server DBA I see my role having 2 main focuses. First is to protect the data and second is to ensure performance is maximized. More often than not companies forget about data security when they focus on performance tuning. In this presentation I will mention a few cases where encryption could have saved a lot of hassle. I will then demo a method that can be used to "index" commonly searched on encrypted values (ex: SSNs, Credit Card, etc) helping reduce the impact on the performance of a query.
