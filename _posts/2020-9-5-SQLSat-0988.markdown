## Title: What's New in SQL Server 2019: 100% Demos
 
**Abstract**:
You haven't installed SQL Server 2019 yet, and you don't want to sit through a bunch of slides. You want to see a series of real-world demos focusing on the features of SQL Server 2019 that will make your users happier with as little work as possible on your part. You don't have time to rewrite all your queries or learn new languages - you just want the database to go faster.

I'm Brent Ozar, and I'll give you the whirlwind tour. I'll focus on just the features that make the biggest bang for the buck, things you can implement right away and see a noticeable difference. I'll show you what kinds of code will benefit the most so you can go back to the office and have an honest discussion with management about what to expect.

No slides here - not even an about-me slide. Let's dive into some queries!

## Title: Power BI Dataflows? Why you need to implement it!
 
**Abstract**:
Not so long ago, Power BI Dataflows have been added to the Power BI landscape. It is showing great promise, as they have the potential of becoming key in every (large) implementation of a Power BI or Hybrid BI Architecture.

During this session, the core concepts of Power BI Dataflows will be explained, and we'll discuss how Power BI Dataflows could alleviate some of the specific problems you might be experiencing in your current architecture.

How this feature ties into some other cool concepts, like Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 or the Common Data Model, obviously can't be missing from this speech.

Expect to walk out of this session with a decent grasp on the underlying architecture, and some key takeaways to take home with you.

## Title: Checking in with Power Apps, Flow and Power BI
 
**Abstract**:
In this session we will create an Power App that will allow users to check-in their location. We will then create a Flow that will take that location and write to a Power BI data source and refresh it. We will then create a Power BI report that will display the data on a map.

Power Apps is a great tool that allows you to create a desktop or mobile app with minimal coding. The app we are creating in this session uses the Bing location services to get the users location when a button is pressed. The Power Automate flow we create in this session will take the location and user information and write it to an Excel file. We will also look at the Power BI connector in Power Automate that will allow us to refresh a Power BI data set. In the Power BI report we will create, we will connect to an Excel file with the location information in it and display it in a report including the location on a map.

The audience will take away useful information about Power Apps, Flow and Power BI including

## Title: BI in Azure two years live
 
**Abstract**:
After more than two years live with BI in Azure Alexander Klein would like to give an honest feedback. 

Which architecture is the right one? Which tools/services should I use ( Azure Data Factory V1 or V2, Azure Stream Analytics, Logic Apps, Azure Functions, Azure SQL DB, Azure SQL DW, Azure Analysis Service, Azure Data Lake, Power BI, Azure Databricks ...) ?
What was good and what wasn't so good? What do you have to pay attention to? What can you possibly do better in the next project?

Alexander Klein will answer all these questions and more in this presentation.

## Title: Creating Scalable Data Pipelines with Azure Data Factory and Data Flows
 
**Abstract**:
One major challenge that data professionals are faced with in the age of Big Data is ensuring that data is in the proper form at the proper time for downstream analytics. This session will discuss the modern data warehouse architecture, and how Azure Data Factory with Mapping and Wrangling Data Flows can be used to ensure that data pipelines deliver the right data at the right time to data consumers.

This session will be a mix of discussion and demo, and attendees will come away with a solid understanding of how these data pipelines are architected and built.

## Title: Dynamic Search Conditions
 
**Abstract**:
A common requirement in database applications is that users want a function to search a set of data from a large set of possible search conditions. The challenge is to implement such searches in a way that is both maintainable and efficient in terms of performance. This session looks at the two main techniques to implement such searches and highlights their strengths and limitations.

## Title: Best Practices for building a Data Lake with Azure Databricks
 
**Abstract**:
Databricks is a Unified Analytics Platform making it easier than ever to do big data analytics on cloud. However, there are a lot of things you need to know and take into account before diving head first into a Data Lake. This session is intended for architects and developers who are looking to build a massive scale data storing and processing solution. I will go through the Best Practices for the purpose. In addition, I will demonstrate how to unify real-time and batch processing using Azure Databricks. As a result, you should feel comfortable building your own Data Lake for your big data processing needs.

## Title: My romantic relation with Powershell generally and  DBATools especially
 
**Abstract**:
I was very late to adopt Powershell in my day-to-day work as a DBA. I did some copy/change "programming" with Powershell. But it wasn't until I got in touch with DBATools that I really understood the power of Powershell.
In this session, I will demo some of the reasons I really love Powershell and DBATools.
I will cover a brief overview of DBATools and then jump into some scenarios where DBATools really helped me, including:
- Automatic restore testing
- Homecooked log shipping
- Migration work
