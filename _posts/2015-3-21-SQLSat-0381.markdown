## Title: Performance Tuning Pit Stop for DBAs
 
**Abstract**:
Our users are in constant demand of faster running servers that spill out data before they can blink. Performance can be hard to measure and improve.  Before we get in the race we will cover how to get a Performance baseline using the PAL Tools. The first Pit Stop will be to review TempDB setup to improve performance. Before getting into high gear we'll pull over to refuel on some Log File best practices and performance implications of VLFs. Finally before passing the checkered flag we'll make one more stop to talk about Data Files and improving your mileage from there. After this session you'll have a good idea of how to make changes transparent to any application to get your server crossing that finish line in style!

## Title: How In-Memory Database Objects Affect Database Design
 
**Abstract**:
With SQL Server 2014, Microsoft has added a major new feature to help optimize OLTP database implementations by persisting your data primarily in RAM. Of course it isn't that simple, internally everything that uses this new feature is completely new. While the internals of this feature may be foreign to you, accessing the data that uses the structures very much resembles T-SQL as you already know it. As such, the first important question for the average developer will be how to adapt an existing application to make use of the technology to achieve enhanced performance. In this session, I will start with a normalized database, and adapt the logical and physical database model/implementation in several manners, performance testing the tables and code changes along the way.

## Title: Dealing with Dirty Data with SQL Server and SSIS
 
**Abstract**:
Dirty data is everywhere, and it's headed for a database near you. Extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) can be difficult, but often the most challenging component of that process is the validation and clean up of data. Information must be cleansed in such a way that it retains its original message and business value, while conforming to the expectations of the destination system(s).

In this session, we'll discuss some design patterns for addressing different types of dirty data using SQL Server Integration Services. We will review the various cleansing tools accessible from within SSIS including native Integration Services components, T-SQL, and SSIS scripting. In addition, we'll briefly review the new SQL Server Data Quality Services and its integration with SSIS. We'll cap off the discussion with demonstrations of several methods for data cleansing.

## Title: Scripting out  SQL Server for Documentation and Disaster Recovery
 
**Abstract**:
Most DBAs need to use multiple native and third party tools to fully document SQL Server instances yet still dont get all the objects.
Even using Visual Studio and Database Projects, not all objects are exportable and live at the server level, above the database.
Using Powershell, we will script out an organized set of files that can be checked into any Source Control system and or used for moving or recovering a SQL server instance for Disaster Recovery purposes.
Objects exported include: SQL Agent Jobs/Alerts/Schedules, NT Service Credentials, SSIS-MSDB, SSIS-Catalog, SSAS Cubes, SSRS Reports, Logins, Server Configs, Linked Servers, DB Mail Operators/Accounts, and Server Triggers

## Title: But it worked great in Dev!  Perfomance for Devs
 
**Abstract**:
If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.

## Title: Hacking Exposé - Using SSL to Protect SQL Connections
 
**Abstract**:
Are you someone (A DBA, Developer, etc) that connects to SQL Server to use data?
You probably hear a lot about how protected your database can be when at rest. But what about when you connect to SQL and start running some queries?
Using a simple hacking technique we will dig into some packets on our network and see what's in them. You may be shocked! Then we will create a self-signed SSL certificate, use it to encrypt our connections on the SQL Server,  and see the actual changes in the packet as hackers would.
*Warning - do not try some of these demos at work without proper permissions as hacking techniques are used.

## Title: Query Compilation and Plan Caching
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server often appears to be a black box. Queries go in and results come out. But a lot goes into making that happen. In this session, we will take a look at the stages that SQL Server goes through when it compiles a query plan and some of the optimization that can be used. Once compiled the plans can be cached for reuse. I will explain where the plans get cached to and how SQL Server knows when it can re-use a plan.
