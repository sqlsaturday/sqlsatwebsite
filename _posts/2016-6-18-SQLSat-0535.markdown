## Title: A Glimpse of Polyglot Persistence with Azure Data Services offerings
 
**Abstract**:
Modern cloud applications and services demand for different persistence technologies as they require high volume and diversified data types to be stored. 
Relying on relational data storage is no more feasible, at the same time NoSQL databases do not provide all the great stuff relational databases provide. 
Some solutions overwhelm the usage of NoSQL databases while others have adaptability issues and learning challenges, so finding the right balance between the relational and NoSQL is confusing. 

But the future seems very clear that polygot persistence solutions are the way to design and develop the applications.

This session will help you to understand the fundamentals of the NoSQL offerings of Azure - Table Storage and Document DB and then will give some real world case studies of how polygot persistence could be used along side Azure SQL Databases, which will guide you in making decisions in designing your application.

**Abstract**:
SQL server is a first class citizen in Microsoft Azure IaaS. Regardless of the where SQL workloads are hosted, it takes a rock solid BCP solution in place to guarantee minimum business impact when an unexpected disaster happens. If your organization is planning to move SQL server workloads to Microsoft Azure, preparing a proper contingency plan to recover in case of a disaster would be a mission critical task for DBAs and IT PROs. 

This demo driven session will explore the high availability and disaster recovery options for SQL IaaS in Microsoft Azure, design considerations for a highly available SQL deployment and leveraging Azure's cloud backup capabilities in SQL IaaS VMs.

## Title: On-premise database. Files in the cloud.
 
**Abstract**:
The responsibility over managing data files, security, availability and bearing maintenance cost is not always affordable and not easy too. Microsoft gave us a solution for this starting with SQL Server 2012, though we haven't noticed it much. But now with added enhancements, it is worth to give it a shot with SQL Server 2016, since the benefits are significant. SQL Server data files in Azure offers you several hybrid solutions by providing several benefits for data virtualization, data movement, security and availability, and any easy low cost maintenance for high-availability and elastic scaling. Join this session to discuss this.
