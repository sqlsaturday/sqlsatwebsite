## Title: You don't need Enterprise Edition to do that!
 
**Abstract**:
The most coveted features of SQL Server are made available in Enterprise Edition and are sometimes released into Standard Edition a few years later. This often leaves a vast group of users who "window shop" the latest and greatest features and return to the office wishing they never saw those features presented. 

This session will show you how you can achieve the same, or at least a similar, outcome to some of those features without having to fork out for Enterprise Edition licenses or breaking any license agreements. 

You will leave the session with a set of solution concepts covering Partitioning, Data Compression and High Availability that you can build upon or extend and maybe save you and your company a nice pile of cash.

## Title: Mastering DML Operations like a master
 
**Abstract**:
DML operations mean lot of work for the database engine of Microsoft SQL Server. Understanding the details of a DML transaction may give you great benefits when planning workloads for INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE operations.

Come and learn the differences of space allocation/deallocation between Clustered Indexes and Heaps in this demo oriented session. It will answer these questions:

What is the difference of data page allocation for heaps and clustered indexes?
What is the amount of transaction log when you update data in a heap and/or in a clustered index?
What are the differences when data are delete from a heap and clustered index?
Can ETL processes be improved by usage of the right strategy for INSERTS and DELETES?
What performance drawbacks have Page Splits and Forwarded Records for my application design?

## Title: Flying Through the Clouds--Performance Tuning in Azure
 
**Abstract**:
So between your management and Microsoft, it’s been decided that you are moving your SQL Server workloads to the cloud. Whether it’s Microsoft Azure SQL Database or running SQL Server in a VM, there are unique performance tuning challenges that are different in a cloud environment. Just like when you moved your SQL Servers from physical to virtual environments, you will learn new techniques for tuning workloads. In this session you will learn about:

•	Optimizing TempDB in an Azure VM
•	Reducing latency between application VMs and database VMs
•	Right sizing Azure VMs for performance and cost
•	Striping I/O across devices in Azure VMs
•	Performance Tuning in Azure DB

You will learn about techniques that will not just improve your system performance, but save you company money, which can be easily quantified just in time for your performance review.

## Title: Introducing the SQL Server 2016 Query Store
 
**Abstract**:
With the release of the public preview versions of SQL Server 2016 we were finally able to play with, in my opinion, one of the most exciting new features in SQL Server 2016, the Query Store! The Query Store serves as a flight recorder for your query workload and provides valuable insights into the performance of your queries. It doesn’t stop there however, using the performance metrics the Query Store records, we can decide which Execution Plan SQL Server should use when executing a specific query. If those two features aren’t enough, the Query Store provides all this information inside easy-to-use reports and Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) removing a great deal of the complexity of query performance analysis.
During this session we will take a thorough look at the Query Store, it’s architecture, the build-in reporting, DMVs and the performance impact of enabling the Query Store. No matter if you are a DBA or developer, the Query Store has information that can help you!

## Title: Natural Born Killers, Performance Issues to Avoid
 
**Abstract**:
Learning SQL is easy, mastering it is hard. In this session you’ll learn simple but effective tricks to design your database objects better and write more optimized code. As an attendee you will gain a deeper understanding of common database development and administration mistakes, and how you can avoid them.

Ever thought that you were adhering to best practices but still seeing performance problems? You might well be. In this session I will be covering why the optimizer isn’t using all available processors, when the database engine fails to report all the resources a query has used and why the optimizer doesn’t always use the best plan.

You will leave this session with a list of things that you can check for in your environment to improve performance for your users.

## Title: Securing SQL Server, Patterns and Practices
 
**Abstract**:
Security is at the forefront of many organizations minds, but there are many options to choose from and getting a security configuration right can take time and effort. Let me give you a head start when it comes to helping secure your SQL Servers from the malicious, inquisitive, and opportunists.

Starting with a good security baseline configuration that you can then build on is vital, it provides a strong foundation on which to build more robust configurations. I will show you how to secure data during transmission, and at rest, demonstrating how to get Manages Service Accounts to work for your systems. From here we look at securing systems for PCI-DSS and PII that falls under the data protection act, two of the main compliance requirements encountered today.

After attending this session, you will be in a strong position to effectively secure your SQL Server systems.

Security should be the rule, not the exception, together we can make this happen.

## Title: Query Optimizer (engl)
 
**Abstract**:
Despite of the fact the Query Optimizer represents one of the core features of SQL Server there is only little know about the internals.

## Title: NoLock,  What does it exactly do ?
 
**Abstract**:
It must be the most common query-hint but exactly why; what does it do?
In this 60 minutes talk,  the NoLock-hint will be explained.
Starting simplistic with explaining the way the ignoring locks works, quick touch on isolation-levels and continue with more difficult example and concept; Read-Past, Ghost-Reads and even duplicate reads.
Only to end with how the 'magic speed' comes to be and what other ways can used to achieve the extra speed.

## Title: Master Data Services: Onbekend maakt Onbemind
 
**Abstract**:
Master Data Services (MDS) bestaat al sinds SQL 2008, maar wordt vaak niet gebruikt. Vo0ornamelijk vanwege de onbekendheid van MDS. En dat terwijl MDS veel van de beheer vraagstukken kan beantwoorden. Zeker gezien de nieuwe features in SQL Server 2016 is MDS een oplossing waar veel organisaties baad bij kunnen hebben. In deze sessie worden verschillende scenario's getoond hoe MDS een BI omgeving kan versterken.

## Title: Extending Power BI via the REST API and Power BI Embedded
 
**Abstract**:
Nowadays Power BI can be called via an API. The API provides the capability of delivering real-time dashboarding scenarios via REST or an easy way to  integrate Power BI reports in your application via Power BI embedded.
During this session I will show the possibilities of the API and how it can be integrated with Azure services, like Stream Analytics and AzureML, or embedded into a custom .NET application with Power BI Embedded to provide either a real-time dashboard for Business and/or IoT scenarios or custom solutions with integrated Power BI dashboards.

I#39;m a Microsoft Business Intelligence consultant at ilionx with a focus on SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS). I started my career with some ASP, ASP.Net, MCMS and SPS assignments and made the switch to BI when Microsoft released SQL Server 2005.
I try to blog at least once a month about SSIS (and related stuff) and  try to answer questions on the SSIS forum on MSDN where I#39;m a moderator. And last year I wrote an SSIS Scripting book to show you how to use C# or VB.Net within SSIS.
