## Title: Create a Data Loading Strategy
 
**Abstract**:
Loading large amounts of data into SQL Server can be challenging. Many factors may challenge your goal for tuned performance. To make the decision making process more difficult, many of the choices listed below have both Pros and Cons to their implementation. For this reason, bulk loading large amounts of data requires a strategy.

Create a strategy to optimize your massive data loading processes.
•	High Performance Data Loading
•	Minimal Logging and Bulk Loading
•	Indexing Considerations
•	Delayed Durability
•	Eager Write

This session uses a Virtual Sandbox to demonstrate “real” data loads using these techniques listed above. We will look at the T-SQL used in these data loads. We will briefly discuss how the different settings and configurations effect the data loads. Power Point slides and sample SQL will be provided.

## Title: Unit Testing SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
In the nearly 20 years I have been working with SQL Server, most of that as an independent consultant, I can count on two hands the number of clients I have come across that had ANY database tests constructed.  I can count on TWO FINGERS the number of them that had repeatable database tests.  Even the most ardent Agile/Scrum/pick-your-new-and-shiny-development-mantra shops hardly ever do anything more than wave a magic wand at testing the database, because it can be REALLY HARD to do and do correctly.  In this session we will cover examples of why repeatable database testing is CRITICALLY important and then examine both a free and a low-cost commercial product to ease the pain and improve developer efficiency.

## Title: Are There Time Bombs in your SSIS Packages?
 
**Abstract**:
Could your seemingly-normal SSIS package be hiding a disaster, waiting to detonate at the most inconvenient time? Integration Services is an incredibly flexible product, and that flexibility can lead to good - and occasionally bad - design patterns. Small and seemingly trivial design decisions can lead to big issues down the road, including leaky data flows, data quality issues, paralyzing performance issues, and other explosive behaviors.

In this session, we will explore some of the most common SSIS design patterns that are potentially more harmful than they first appear. From package configuration to control flow constraints, and data flow transformations to logging, we'll demonstrate what can go wrong and show some alternative designs to prevent these types of problems from developing into bigger issues.

## Title: Testing SSIS Packages
 
**Abstract**:
Senior developer: “How do you test your code?” Junior developer: “I compile it.” It’s an old joke, but too often this reflects the reality of testing. If the code compiles, it has passed its test. Sadly, this principle is sometimes applied to Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) processes as well: “When the SSIS package runs without error, testing is complete.” 

As in software development, testing of SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) packages should not end at when the package executes successfully. You must also confirm that the package does what it was intended to do without placing an undue performance burden on the system.

This session walks through design patterns for testing SSIS packages during and after the development process. The session covers topics such as these:
* Performance testing
* Patterns for validating execution results at runtime
* Validating package metadata before execution
* Design time versus runtime testing
* Making a graceful exit: testing for error handling

## Title: Unraveling Tangled Code:A Spellbinding Tale of Victory Over Chaos
 
**Abstract**:
Once upon a time, you inherited an application or a database that was filled with chaos and inconsistencies. The T-SQL code is overly complex and impossible to ken. The architecture is painful to behold, and grueling to code for. One might optimistically say that query performance is “spectacularly mediocre”. If you’re without good documentation or system architects to guide you, how do you break the curse of confusion? In this session you’ll learn several methods for conquering chaotic code, and how to seek and destroy some of the nastier coding mistakes and inefficiencies. We will break complicated queries into key pieces, turn them upside-down, and reform them into something sensible. We will vanquish major issues like data abuse and index negligence. We will restructure joins and tame subqueries. We will emerge victorious!

## Title: SQL Server R Services in SQL 2016
 
**Abstract**:
One of the most exciting new features of SQL Server 2016 is the integration of the R statistical programming language into the platform with the brand-new SQL Server R Services.  In this introductory session we'll briefly introduce the R language and then look at how to install and administer SQL Server R Services.  We'll start to demonstrate the power of R by showing you how to create and run simple R scripts from within T-SQL.  We'll then discuss some of the powerful open source packages that are available to aid your data analyses.  Finally, we'll go through some examples of how to use R to integrate data analytical methods in real-world situations, and wow your customers with the power of statistics!

## Title: Get Your Optimizer to Give up All Its Secrets
 
**Abstract**:
You know that execution plans can provide you with vital information to tune a query, but just how does that plan get generated?  In this session, we will examine details the query optimization process that are not very well known.  We will discuss how SQL Server parses a T-SQL statement then and begins applying rules to make it more efficient.  Did you know that SQL Server can be coaxed into outputting hidden structures such as parse trees and memos?  We'll do just that, and then take it a step further with a unique visualization tool that I have created.  With a better understanding of how SQL Server optimizes T-SQL (and sometimes doesn't do it as well as might be hoped), you can write more efficient SQL statements.

## Title: T-SQL's Hidden Support Feature
 
**Abstract**:
The most effective T-SQL support feature comes installed with every edition of SQL Server, is enabled by default, and costs no overhead. Yet, the vast majority of database administrator underutilize or completely neglect it. That feature's name is "comments".
#160;
In this session, Microsoft Certified Master Jennifer McCown will demonstrate the various commenting methods that make code supportable. Attendees will#160;learn what’s important in a header comment, use code blocking to edit code, build a comprehensive help system, and explore alternative comment methods in stored procedures, SSIS packages, SSRS reports, and beyond.#160; These methods help prevent errors and reduce troubleshooting.

## Title: Introduction to BIML and BimlScript
 
**Abstract**:
You have a lot of data to move and a lot of pieces to manage. Perhaps you're a developer and know that SSIS is the best way to move it, but you naturally dislike GUI-based development or you're just not looking forward to the tedium.

Or perhaps you're a team lead/architect and are looking for an efficient platform that best utilizes the development skills of your team.

Jeremy Marx will introduce BIML, a language you can quickly pick up to develop SSIS solutions with code, and BIMLscript, intelligently mixing in C# to make your BIML practically build itself.

Jeremy will demonstrate how to build a simple, single-table SSIS package using BIML, then extend it to many tables with just a few lines of code, and finally apply a more robust data flow designed for reuse. You'll leave with tools and resources to begin coding SSIS solutions faster and more efficiently.

## Title: SSIS Performance Tuning with Biml
 
**Abstract**:
You may heard that Biml can automate ETL loads, but what if your data warehouse is several terabytes with a tight load window. In this demo focused presentation, we’ll discuss how to use BimlScript to dynamically create multiple SSIS packages for a data warehouse ETL load, each following a different best practice design pattern. The included framework then automatically executes each package repeatedly, records the results for analysis, and determine which package version should be used in production.
The only way to be sure that your SSIS packages are performing optimally is to test them against multiple patterns. Make your life easier and let BimlScript do the work for you.

## Title: Know What Your Code is Doing to SQL Server!
 
**Abstract**:
ORMs - oh how I LOVE them! As a consultant when I see them in play at a client I go KACHIIINNNNGGGG!! :-D Seriously though, they can provide some substantial benefits for coding throughput. But if you don't Read The Fine Manual and do some things right and avoid some major gotchas you will fall prey to one of my favorite Guruisms: "Anything that allows developers to slap code together more quickly is inversely proportional to the performance and scalability you will get from that code"! Although this talk is based on Entity Framework, most ORMs suffer from a lot of the same flaws.

## Title: Administering SQL Server on Server Core with PowerShell
 
**Abstract**:
Ever wondered what the craze of Server Core is all about? There is a lot of power in Core and with it comes the admin challenge of NO GUI.  But there are settings that you want to change in the OS, how do you do that? This session will take you through some of the challenges that are not really challenges when you know. We will use the builtin method of making some changes and also use PowerShell and commandline tools to get you where you want to be with Core. I built a 6 node cluster on Server Core and created it with PowerShell (Cluster and all) and it runs very nicely with a little footprint in RAM for the effort.
