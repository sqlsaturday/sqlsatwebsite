## Title: Business Intelligence: Decaffeinated Please! 
 
**Abstract**:
For many Database Administrators, Data Analysts and other IT and Business Professionals, Business Intelligence (BI) and Data Warehousing (DW) may be a new and uncharted territory with no clear path towards the destination. Others, who have already jumped head-on into the Business Intelligence journey, may be facing challenges that can potentially put their efforts at risk of failure. In this session I will go over some of the basic concepts that are key in understanding BI and DW. I will also go over the natural roadmap towards BI success, its maturity stages and some of the factors that influence a successful BI project. I will exemplify all these concepts by showcasing a successful real-world BI and DW solution.

## Title: Managing Database Schemas With VS201 DB projects
 
**Abstract**:
Most developers agree that the database is the most important component in a typical application, yet the processes for managing changes to database objects as part of the development cycle are often rudimentary or inexistent.
In this session Rafael explains how you can use Visual Studio database projects to have better control over your database development cycle and  reduce the risk and complexity involved in managing  schema changes, testing and deployment.  He will talk about the pros and cons he has experienced when using VS DB projects in his last projects, and will highlight some of the  improvements available in the latest version of the tool. 
This session showcases VS 2010, but most the content remains relevant for VSDB2008 GDR2

## Title: Information Visualization - Making great Charts
 
**Abstract**:
This session will provide you with some surprising and interesting insights into how dashboards and charts should be designed. Called Information Visualization, there is a whole line of thinking which maps how the brain interprets what the eyes see. We will translate this into best (and worst) practices related to visualization in dashboard, scorecard, table, and report design. Both funny and informative, you will probably learn, as I did, that you have been designing your dashboards/scorecards and reports badly. We are going to take a visualization test, and learn how to convey information in a clearer, better way. I will prove that you are blind! You will be surprised.  Join me - this session is going to be hoot!

## Title: Planning your ETL architecture with SSIS
 
**Abstract**:
The complexity and importance of Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) projects are often underestimated, and the consequences of a poorly planned and executed ETL project will inevitably lead to maintenance nightmares, low reliability of the system, or worse yet, to the failure of the project. 
In this session, we will use ETL best practices to make a requirements checklist you can use in your next ETL implementation, and will demonstrate  how you can use SSIS to implement and meet  such requirements. If  you already learned the basics about SSIS and now want to take your ETL solutions to the next level, or if you became an SSIS developer/architect by accident and wonder what do you need to succeed, then this is the right session for you.

## Title: Processing Flat Files with SSIS
 
**Abstract**:
When doing data integration, a common requirement is to work with flat files, whether for importing data into a system from an external source, or to export it to provide to other systems. SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) supports flat files, but there can be a number of challenges when working with them. This is particularly true if your flat files have multiple data formats contained in a single file, the data has complex formatting, or the files have inconsistent formatting. This session will help you to be more efficient when working with these types of files. You’ll learn to handle missing delimiters in the files, and parsing files that have multiple data formats.

## Title: Bad SQL
 
**Abstract**:
How do you tell good code from bad?  Bad SQL code makes the system work harder for the same results.  Bad SQL does not scale well with larger data sizes, nor does it scale with increased server activity.  Extreme Bad SQL can bring a server to a grinding halt.   This presentation shows you how and why certain commonly used SQL constructions are Bad SQL.  Bad SQL is not very useful by itself so each example includes its Good SQL counterpart.
