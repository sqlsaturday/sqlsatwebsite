## Title: Free Scripts to Troubleshoot SQL Server: sp_Blitz, sp_BlitzCache, and More
 
**Abstract**:
You inherited a SQL Server and a bunch of databases from The Last Guy, and you're pretty sure he was drinking on the job. You need to find out just how big of a mess he left you, and what you need to focus on fixing first. You don't want a generic health check - you only wanna fix things that users are going to notice.

In this all-demo no-slides session, you'll learn how to use the open source First Responder Kit: sp_Blitz, sp_BlitzCache, sp_BlitzIndex, sp_BlitzFirst, sp_BlitzWho, and more. Brent Ozar, one of the script authors, will show you what each script does and how to read the results. It's all completely free, maintained by community volunteers, no strings attached. Come see what the community has been working on lately!

## Title: Business Analytics in SQL Server 2016
 
**Abstract**:
Ever wonder what’s going on with Microsoft Business Intelligence features? Is everything going to the Cloud, or can I still rely on my own servers to design systems? Well, this session is for you. 

We are going to spend hours on looking at the new features of SQL Server 2016 that will help you create on premise solutions for you company or clients that complement the solutions you have already built. SQL Server 2016 not only gives you new tools like R integration and Mobile Reporting, but enhances Analysis Services and Reporting Services you have been using for years.

You will leave with a comforting feeling that Microsoft is not leaving you behind if you do not or cannot go to the Cloud. Perhaps we shall see the thunder of BI love to what we know best and to succeed in the future.

## Title: A Rocket Scientist View on Indexes
 
**Abstract**:
Indexes can be a boon or decrement for query performance. This presentation will present what they are (in layman’s terms) and how they may affect query performance – both from a read (SELECT) viewpoint as well as a data modification aspect (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).  This session will concentrate with a deep dive into clustered indexes and nonclustered indexes, their syntax and utilization, and their effect on performance in transaction and data warehouse databases.  Covering nonclustered indexes will also be examined in detail and the scenarios they should be applied.  There will be many query demos illustrating index utilization using statistics and query plans.  Attendee should have some TSQL and Management Studio experience.

## Title: I like big data for $400  - Exploring quiz show questions using Angular, DocumentDB and Azure Search
 
**Abstract**:
In this talk, we will explore two powerful technologies from the Microsoft Azure Stack: DocumentDB and Azure Search. DocumentDB is Microsoft's NoSQL service for building globally scalable schema-free applications. Azure Search allows you to integrate the power of Microsoft's search and natural language processing abilities to explore your complex data stores. During this talk we will cover the benefits of implementing a schema-free database, we will learn how to replicate your data at a global scale with the ease of a simple configuration and we will cover various techniques of querying that data using SQL and the DocumentDB API. Once we have a large datastore in place (we will use 200k+ Jeopardy questions), we will apply the powerful natural language querying capabilities and faceted search features of Azure Search to quickly create an searchable data repository. All of this will be built and exposed using a cross-platform application built in Angular on the Electron framework.

## Title: Inside SQL Server In-Memory OLTP
 
**Abstract**:
Based on the successful 500 Level talk at PASS 2016, this session will provide an internals view of how In-Memory OLTP works for SQL Server 2016. Because this session is Advanced, it is intended for those that understand the basic fundamentals of In-Memory OLTP but want to learn how the "Hekaton" engine works behind the scenes to deliver the amazing 30x performance improvements seen for customers moving to In-Memory OLTP. This session will include a look behind the scenes at threads, data and index design, transactions and concurrency, logging, storage, and natively compiled procedures. And since this will be an advanced level session, of course the demonstration of the looking at the Hekaton engine with the debugger is a must.

## Title: Table Partitioning: the Secret Weapon for Your Big Data Problems
 
**Abstract**:
Is big data starting to slow you down? Is data growth putting your maintenance tasks in danger of not meeting your service level agreements? Do you wish you could archive old data with minimal impact to your tables during the archive process? Do you wish you could eliminate the majority of the data in your tables when you query them? If so, it's time you consider implementing table partitioning to help with your general performance and to reduce your maintenance window for completing your maintenance tasks. 

In this session, you will learn how table partitioning works and when it should be implemented. You will be able to understand how to initially configure partition functions and partition schemes to have a rock solid partitioned table. You learn how to implement new features added in SQL Server 2014 to improve table partitioning.  Finally, you will learn how to implement an automated sliding window to maintain your partitioned tables for ensuring optimal performance.

## Title: What to Do When SQL Server is Slow
 
**Abstract**:
Someone comes running in and asks, "Are you doing something on the SQL Server right now? Can you take a look at it? It seems really slow."

It's one of the most common complaints we get about our databases - and yet, most of us don't have a written plan with what steps to take, in order.

I do this for a living, so I've had to make a written checklist to handle it. I'll give you the exact same checklist I use, then walk you through several performance emergencies. I'll show you how I use open source scripts like sp_WhoIsActive, sp_BlitzFirst, sp_BlitzCache, and more to find the root cause fast. We won't cover performance tuning - our goal in this hour is just to have a written triage process so we don't look like bumbling idiots. Let's get good at this!

## Title: Backups for non-DBAs...the Why, not the How
 
**Abstract**:
Join me and get some new perspective on what your DBA is doing, and why!

Targeted at the non-DBA such as BI/DW folks, Application Developers, Managers, and System Admins, this session will go over the reasons we back up our databases, our systems, etc.  Considerations such as Single points of failure, High Availability/Disaster recovery, Business Continuity and others will be discussed in this interactive conversation.   It will be conversation heavy, with supporting slides to download, and one Database backup demo at the end if time permits.

Everyone involved in a technical role needs to at least know that the things they have created will be recoverable in the event of a disaster, or even just an "oops" moment.   The CIO/CTO should know how long critical systems will be down when bad things happen.  Backups are everyone's responsibility...whether asking the right questions or implementing the process.

## Title: Database Project Makes Deployment Consistent
 
**Abstract**:
The deployment process is frustrating; an object is missing, an object is deployed in the wrong order or an incorrect version. Deploying to multiple environments like Dev, QA, UAT and Prod is a challenge whither on premise or in the cloud. Source controlling database objects is paramount. Team development is required. Database code will only be deployed when changed. Proper security deployment will be repeatable per environment. Together, let us discover how using Database Project will help us with consistent releases. Deployments can cause you trouble but we will share a reliable deployment and version control process. Let’s see how Database Project can help us accomplish this goal.

## Title: SQL Server Graph Database
 
**Abstract**:
The next version of SQL Server will run on either Windows or Linux and includes new functionality including graph database features. Graph databases are ideal for those cases where there is a relationship that exists but it doesn't fit the rigid hierarchy of a relational table. Graph databases easily manage data where there are differing degrees of separation - the so-called Kevin Bacon problem. The degrees of separation problem is highly relevant to important real world problems such as root cause analysis, bill of materials, parts explosion, where used queries, route planning, and fraud detection just to name a few. New syntax exists is take advantage of storing and processing relationships. Learn how this transformative technology works and then update your resume!

## Title: Querying Semistructured Data in Azure Data Lake with USQL
 
**Abstract**:
Data is exploding across enterprises.  Much of it is semi-structured junk.  Or is it junk?  What are you going to do with it until you can find out?  Microsoft’s Azure Data Lake is a cloud storage and analytical service for parking a variety of data.  When you are ready, you can query that semi-structured data using an ANSI SQL language called U-SQL.  In this session I will demonstrate the similarities and differences between U-SQL and T-SQL.  I will demonstrate how easy it is to build a query against 21 GB of CSV files. Such queries can help you determine whether you have a gold mine in your data or a bunch of garbage before investing in a full data warehouse build.

## Title: Inside SQL Server Machine Learning Services: Database Intelligence at Scale
 
**Abstract**:
You are a DBA of SQL Server deploying or considering SQL Server 2016 or SQL Server 2017. Your manager says that Data Science is the “new thing” and there are Data Scientists in your company that need your help. SQL Server 2016 introduced a new capability called SQL Server R Services and you need to evaluate whether this feature is something your company can trust to deploy in production for an enterprise environment. SQL Server 2017 expands this feature to include Python and what we now called SQL Server Machine Learning Services. We will explore and understand exactly how SQL Server Machine Learning Services works behind the scenes so you know how to install it, manage it, optimize it, and have confidence to use this in real prediction analytic workloads. We will use demos so you understand all the components and look at a real enterprise customer case study as part of this talk.

## Title: Why should I care about ... the plan cache?
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this installment of Rick's "Why should I care" series, he lays out a case for why working knowledge of the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments. A review of relevant views and functions is included for the (newly?) motivated audience.

Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why their DBAs drink in the morning (allegedly). This is not a deep dive into the cache, it really is primarily a session exploring _why_ these DMOs are worth slogging through.

**Abstract**:
In an automated world, it’s easy to feel like we are losing the tight control we used to have on some of our daily processes. Other processes have remained manual out of fear of losing that same control. What if there was a way to keep the control and automate the process at the same time? In this session, I go over my experiences with different ways of managing schema changes over the life of a project and explore a controlled and automated approach.
