## Title: A Game of Hierarchies: From Joins to Recursive CTEs
 
**Abstract**:
Hierarchies are the bread and butter of most business applications and you find them almost everywhere:
* Product Categories
* Sales Territories
* Calendar and Time
Even when there is a big need from a business perspective, the solutions in relational databases are still sort of awkward. Since Version 2008, SQL Server makes life a bit easier with the data type hierarchyid. If you want to successfully query self-referenced hierarchies, you will need recursive common table expressions. To make use of aggregations, you have to master GROUP BY clauses, as well as GROUPING SETS, CUBE, ROLLUP, WITH CUBE, and WITH ROLLUP.
If these terms caught your attention, then join this session for a journey through best practices to model your hierarchies and handy scripts to transform your hierarchies into useful information. We will have fun playing around with a sample database based on G. R. R. Martin’s famous "Game of Thrones".

## Title: Azure Data Lake Store / Analytics 101
 
**Abstract**:
In this session we take a look and a deep dive into Aure Data Lake, a new feature on Azure that will enable amost anyone to work with BIG DATA. It combines C# and SQL to a language that is way more intuitive than what we are used to.

Azure Data Lake Store, our new repository for data of various origins – we can collect, store and share data from this lake as we see fit. Azure Data Lake Analytics, a new way to scale and use your analytics on AZURE and BIG Data, it introduces U-SQL a new language combined of C# and T-SQL to make the task of analyzing BIG Data easier and more comprehendible. Azure Data Lake Tools for Visual Studio, provide an integrated development environment that spans the Azure Data Lake, dramatically simplifying authoring, debugging and optimization for processing and analytics at any scale. After this session, you will have an understanding of the new feature, and will hopefully be inspired to use it either in a Proof Of Concept or in a Production scenario.

## Title: JSON    XML;  since SQL 2016 it is important to weigh respective advantage
 
**Abstract**:
The session begins with „JSON“ and shows with a syntax-comparison the similarities to XML.
Both the different operational scenarios and the technical background
of JSON and XML, however, require a different range of functions and language.
Therefore, initially, as far as practicable the parallels will be demonstrated.
Especially the T-SQL  extensions  „FOR JSON“  and  „OpenJSON“  are very similarly implemented in comparison to „FOR XML“ and „OpenXML“.
Furthermore the new functions  „IsJSON“,  „JSON_VALUE“ and  „JSON_QUERY“  are now contained in T-SQL. Do they also have these as T-SQL functions for XML or can these results be calculated with XML-methods?
Additionally, XML has some more features which concern saving ( and indexing ) and requesting 
(in particular with XQuery) in relational tables. These will also be demonstrated exemplary. 
The goal of the session is to show, when which language is of advantage in which case.

## Title: Windows Server 2016 Infrastructure for SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
A paradigm shift has occurred in how SQL Server platforms are designed and built. For the last 4 years it has been possible to design a platform for SQL Server 2012/2014/2016 where you no longer need a SAN to create a high-available SQL Server and where I/O is no longer a problem.

Windows Server 2016 will not only increase functionality from previous versions but brings entirely new features such as Storage Spaces Direct and Storage Replica to the table.

The session will briefly cover the Windows Server 2012 R2 and SQL Server 2012/2014/2016 setups, but we can also add this functionality to older versions of SQL Server.

But the main part will show how new Windows Server 2016 features for the first time can overcome SQL Server limitations, all the way up to and including SQL Server 2014.

This will all be based on the last version of Windows 2016 before release and show results from the first customer in the world to run this in full production on the beta builds.

## Title: GIving Permissions through Stored Procedures
 
**Abstract**:
You probably know that with a stored procedure you can permit users to access or update data even if they have no direct permissions on the table. But you may have noticed that this does not work when the SP uses dynamic SQL. 

In this session you will learn why it is so and techniques how you can use to overcome this. You will also learn that the same techniques can be to permit users to perform specific actions they need to do without granting them general high-level permissions on database or server level by packaging these actions into a stored procedure. You will also learn why should should be careful with setting a database TRUSTWORTHY.

The session should be of interest both to DBAs and application developers that need to consider advanced permissions in their stored procedures.

## Title: Continuous Integration with SSDT and Team Foundation Server
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) is Microsoft developer tools for working with SQL Server databases on premises and in the cloud. It supersedes Management Studio in development functionality. Team Foundation Server (TFS) is the collaboration platform at the core of Microsoft’s application lifecycle management (ALM) solution. TFS gives you the tools you need to effectively manage software development projects throughout the IT lifecycle. In this session, we are going to focus on the interaction between SSDT and TFS. Developing locally and publishing the changes to an on-premises instance of SQL Server. We will look at how we can do continuous integration between development and other environments pushing the schema changes and upgrading the version numbers in a seamless manner upon successful build of the solution. Furthermore we'll look at how to lift the integration to an even greater level by using Microsoft Release Management thus automating the deployment and testing of your software.

## Title: Complex Event Processing with Azure Stream Analytics
 
**Abstract**:
Azure Stream Analytics targets complex event streams (CEP’s) to deduce meaningful patterns. Most of the typical use cases for this product is when various devices and sensors are sending data for further processing.

This technology uses a T-SQL like syntax to express its intents. A language that most data-power users will be familiar with.

The biggest advantage of Stream Analytics is when events are being published to the Stream Analytics, the only thing that event publishers needs to know is which Event Bus or Blob storage to place the data. Stream Analytics will then fetch the data.

This talk is about the main concepts and solution architecture when using Azure Stream Analytics, and also how to use this technology together with MS SQL Server, Azure SQL Database and Power BI.

## Title: How to monitor efficiently your SQL Server instances
 
**Abstract**:
Do you plan to start monitoring your SQL Server instances soon and asking yourself what should you measure? Are you questioning if your existing monitoring data can detect and alert if a performance problem occurs? Is the data you collected from monitoring enough to pinpoint the cause of your next performance problem?

I have worked with SQL Server as a developer in the Redmond team for more than 12 years and during this time I've investigated countless performance problems. In time I developed a strategy on how to use the performance monitoring data to analyze problems and identify the root cause. This session is going to to show you how I monitor SQL Server, what data do I look for, and how I interpret the collected data to analyze performance issues. Going beside the obvious CPU, Memory and IO counters, I will show you how to identify typical performance issues from monitoring data, all without overwhelming the captured data volume.

## Title: Latches, Spinlocks, and Lock Free Data Structures
 
**Abstract**:
You know locking and blocking very well in SQL Server? You know how the isolation level influences locking? Perfect! Join me in this session to make a further deep dive into how SQL Server implements physical locking with lightweight synchronization objects like Latches and Spinlocks. We will cover the differences between both, and their use-cases in SQL Server. You will learn about best practices how to analyze and resolve Latch- and Spinlock contentation for your performance critical workload. At the end we will talk about lock free data structures, what they are, and how they are used by the new In-Memory OLTP technology that is part of SQL Server 2014.

## Title: Lightning Talks By Hugo Kornelis, John Martin and Jens Vestergaard
 
**Abstract**:
Managing Execution Plans - By Hugo Kornelis
An execution plan is in many ways similar to an organisation. And the operators are like the employees, trying hard (and sometimes even succeeeding) to work together effectively. Managing people, or execution plans, is easier if you know their idiosyncrasies. In this lightning talk, I will highlight a few of my favorite empl... eehrmm, operators; and tell you what you need to know in order to manage them effectively. 

Do you Trust Me? - By John Martin
Let me show you why you really ought not to trust those databases and what you can do if you need to.

## Title: The current state of Powershell DSC for DBAs
 
**Abstract**:
Powershell Desired State Configuration (DSC) is a declarative configuration management system.
Most DBAs are probably using unattended installs followed by a bunch of post configuration scripts to make sure their SQL Server instances are production ready.
We will take a look at how Powershell DSC works, and how this can be used by DBAs to install, configure and manage SQL Servers.
I will try to answer questions like:

How does Powershell DSC work?
How would a DBA use Powershell DSC?
Are the resources to manage SQL Server mature enough?

After this session you are better equiped to decide if Powershell DSC is useful for you, now or in the near future.

## Title: All things time related
 
**Abstract**:
In many data warehouses we model fact tables with measures based on attributes which we can count and do arithmetic upon. It is more difficult to handle fact tables with measures based on length of intervals of events happening in the source systems. So questions like "What are the typical waiting times in our order process?" are seldomly modelled in the data warehouse. Especially if the event data comes from different source systems. 

In this talk I will show you different techniques and models related to time: process mining, lean, six sigma, process datawarehousing, relational temporal theory and SQL 2016 temporal
