## Title: Tuna Helper - Proven Process for Tuning SQL
 
**Abstract**:
Many DBAs and Developers are faced with tuning poorly performing SQL statements.  However, many tuning projects fail because the process being used is inefficient. This presentation will walk through a process Confio Software uses with great success and will include topics such as: SQL diagramming, wait time data, indexing strategies, column selectivity and several more that will help the you succeed on future tuning projects.

## Title: Working With XML in SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
XML in SQL 2000 wasn't very exciting and it was easy to dismiss it altogether by just relying on developers to handle any XML needed within the application. SQL 2005 changes the game and this session will show you how to use the XML data type, do basic operations on XML data, and showcase the changes to FOR XML that make it so much more useful. This isn't a session to convince you to use XML, but to show you what you can do with XML if you do need to use it!
Session Goals:
•	Learn how to use FOR XML PATH and WITH NAMESPACE clauses
•	Understand the basic use of the XML data type and XML schema collections
•	Learn how to use XML DML to manipulate XML data

## Title: Wait-Time Based SQL Server Performance Management
 
**Abstract**:
Using Wait Time Analysis and Wait Types is a newer method for tuning SQL Server instances. As a result, there is often confusion on exactly what the data means. The issue typically centers around the fact the wait time data is analyzed at the wrong level or the collected wait time data is not detailed enough. This presentation will focus on these problems and review several real-life case studies of using SQL Server Wait Type data coupled with Wait-Time based performance analysis to solve the most difficult performance related issues.

REST is an architectural style that allows for a layered, scalable, and

uses. Then we will set up a data service using an existing database that
developers would then access rather than accessing the database
directly.
