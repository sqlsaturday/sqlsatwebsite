## Title: SQL Server + SharePoint = BI Solutions
 
**Abstract**:
Tightly integrated with SQL Server, SharePoint 2010 offers greater BI capabilities through the new PerformancePoint Service, enhanced functionality in Excel Services. This integration of the most-used collaboration and productivity portal with BI products makes SharePoint the most powerful platform for building your BI solutions.In this session, we'll use the BI tools in SharePoint 2010 including using Chart Web Part to graph lists, Excel Services to expose data via REST API, and PerformancePoint to create an interactive scorecard and dashboard. You will learn not only how to take full advantage of these tools to successfully develop your BI solutions, but also why and how BI can work for your business.

## Title: Predictive Analytics - You Can, Too!
 
**Abstract**:
Predictive analytics is no longer exclusively for those shops that have the resources to design and implement an entire BI architecture. In this session, we will review a class of modeling problems that are not only quite powerful, but are amenable to implementation via relatively simple T-SQL querying. All it takes to get started is the data available in your OLTP system, a basic understanding of the math, and a bit of imagination…

## Title: Looney Tuner?  No, there IS a method to my madness
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server query tuning is often more art than science and it can quickly eat up a lot of DBA and/or Developer time. This presentation will outline a method for determining the best approach for tuning queries by utilizing response time analysis and SQL diagramming techniques. Regardless of the complexity of the statement, this quick, systematic approach will lead you down the correct tuning path with no guessing. If you are a beginner or expert, this approach will save you countless hours tuning a query.

## Title: SSIS + SharePoint = Interoperability
 
**Abstract**:
Interacting with SharePoint has been a challenge due to the fact that getting data into and out of SharePoint is still not very straight-forward. There are a few different ways to extract or load SharePoint data including SharePoint APIs, Web Services, and Client Object Model. What is the best way to get data out of or into a SharePoint list?

This session will demonstrate the techniques to simplify access to the SharePoint Lists and to get data into and out of SharePoint lists easily by using SSIS. You will learn how to combine Web Services, CAML and ETL tools to create a high performance data integration solution.

## Title: SQL Server Analysis Services: a 10,000-foot view
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) began life as OLAP Services in SQL Server 7, over a decade ago. Since then there have been major architectural enhancements and SSAS now plays a central role in Micorosoft's Business Intelligence (BI) platform.

This session will describe major SSAS functionality, with demos to illustrate key features. We'll also examine the new SSAS features in SQL Server 2008 R2.

## Title: BI: Then and Now 
 
**Abstract**:
We will take a look at how the focus and characteristics of BI have changed over the last 25 years up to the present. We will also discuss the recent history of Microsoft's focus on BI, and will take an in-depth look another approach to SQL Server-based BI provided by Strategy Companion Corporation. You will see why companies such as Citigroup, L'Oreal, Honeywell, DataQuick, and many others have embraced Analyzer, Strategy Companion's award-winning, zero-footprint front-end to Analysis Services for their BI applications. You'll see why SQL Server magazine called Analyzer "the best solution to complete the Microsoft BI platform" and how you can quickly implement cost-effective, self-service BI for your non-technical business users.

## Title: Lessons Learned:Being Agile in a Waterfall Sandbox
 
**Abstract**:
Scrum and XP have found a strong following in the development community.  But most non-development groups (such as Web Administrators, Production Support, Security, Testing, and Users/Stake Holders) inside the enterprise are not only far from agile, that are not trying to move to be more agile. I start with a refresher on Scrum, and then use real experiences from large enterprise development projects to teach you how to effectively work with non-agile teams.  Instead of trying to "convert" them, I discuss strategies to adapt to their needs while remaining agile in the development realm.

## Title: Confio Ignite VM - Monitoring with a Big Picture V
 
**Abstract**:
More and more companies are virtualizing with VMWare, and SQL Server databases are moving in that direction as well. This presentation will demonstrate how Confio Ignite for VM can assist DBAs with performance - not only at the database layer but at the  VM and host layers. Armed with this birds eye view, DBAs can finally have some say about the environment their databases live in.

## Title: Windows Presentation Foundation for Developers
 
**Abstract**:
WPF has now been out for a bit, and we've all seen the spinning cube playing a different video on each side.  How does that help you, the line of business developer?  I dive into what’s important to developers, including Layout, Event and Commands, and a deep dive into Binding, Templates, and Converters.

## Title: Mocks, Stubs, and Dependency Injection, Oh My!
 
**Abstract**:
So you aren't writing any code without having tests in place…well, except for those tricky things like web services, database calls, and that section of code that no one wants to touch since it's a pile of spaghetti.  I start with a big ball of mud and refactor that using dependency injection, fakes, stubs, and mocks.  I will show you how to use Mocks and Stubs to isolate the system under test and write cleaner, more effective tests.

## Title: So... You've Inherited "The DB From Heck" (v2.0)
 
**Abstract**:
It's nice when, as database developers, we have a clean slate to work with. Most of the time, however, we inherit and must support existing designs and implementations. To add to the challenge, more often than not documentation of the database doesn't exist or is out-of-date with respect to the production system.

In this session, we'll look at some tools, techniques, and scripts that will accelerate your understanding of that beast you're now in charge of supporting and extending, with a focus on identifying and correcting design and implementation anomalies.

## Title: What’s new in ASP.NET MVC 3: Building NerdDinner
 
**Abstract**:
Many changes were introduced in ASP.NET MVC 3, including the addition of the Razor view engine and better support for dependency injection. I will demonstrate how to take advantage of ASP.NET MVC 3 by showing you how to build the software behind NerdDinner.com and extend that to e-commerce with an AppStore.

## Title: Code like a Ninja: Enhance Your Productivity
 
**Abstract**:
The sheer number of features in Visual Studio can be overwhelming to the novice. Even seasoned .NET developers constantly discover new techniques from their colleagues. Despite this, there are some features missing from Visual Studio which are covered by Telerik’s JustCode.
This session covers features of Visual Studio and JustCode that make you more productive as a developer. It covers items of interest from novice to advanced developers. Why waste your time modifying dozens of files due to one refactoring? Code like a Ninja!

## Title: Mission Possible:  Pervasive BI
 
**Abstract**:
Making Business Intelligence pervasive throughout an organization has proven to be the “Holy Grail” for many companies – recognized as of immense value but also difficult to attain. In this session we will take a look at the definition, benefits, obstacles, and requirements of Pervasive BI, as well as techniques and technologies which have made SQL Server-based Pervasive BI a “Mission Possible” for many organizations. We will then take a look at a case study of a large internal corporate deployment of Pervasive BI built on SQL Server Analysis Services.

## Title: Secrets of a .NET Ninja
 
**Abstract**:
In my years developing C# applications, I have seen techniques both good and bad. I will demonstrate those that are good, rant against those that are bad, and reveal those unknown to many. Whether a novice or a seasoned coder, you will find something useful, or perhaps even wicked, that you can do with C# and the .NET Framework.
