## Title: I/O Tuning 101
 
**Abstract**:
One of the most common problems I have encountered as a DBA is the complaints from users that a particular query is slow, just one query.  Many times one that used to run in acceptable time, but that over time has slowed down substantially.

In this session we will show some of the causes for this, with emphasis on I/O requests being too high for the query.  

First part of the session will explain how to find these numbers, looking at a few queries with some major performance issues, including explaining why they have a problem.

The second part will focus on how to reduce I/O requests.

All of this can be done without the need for any 3rd party tools, all within the scope of what is available to SQL Server, all versions, all editions, including Azure.

## Title: Hacking SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
How easy is it to hack a SQL Server? 
In this session we'll see examples on how to exploit SQL Server, modify data and take control, while at the same time not leaving a trace.
We'll start by gaining access to a SQL Server (using some "creative" ways of making man-in-the-middle attacks), escalating privileges and tampering with data at the TDS protocol level (e.g. changing your income level and reverting without a trace after payment), hacking DDM, and more. 
Most importantly, we'll also cover recommendations on how to avoid these attacks, and take a look at the pros and cons of new security features in SQL Server 2016.
This is a demo-driven session, suited for DBAs, developers and security consultants.
Disclaimer: No actual crimes will be committed. Please do not send agents to my house again.

## Title: Data Visualisation - More Than a Hygiene Factor
 
**Abstract**:
"For many companies data visualization is still a hygiene factor; necessary but not crucial"

In a world where everyone wants to use data to drive their business forward it is important to be able to communicate and speak the language of data even though data itself can be complex. One way of doing this is by making good data visualisations. Good data visualisations are engaging, they are informative and they let your data tell you its story. Too often data visualisation gets a low priority making the final result feeling lacklustered and making the users uninspired. 

In this session we look at some data visualisation principles and best practices, in order to deliever your message with a clear point of view and minimize confusion. Lastly we will look at how you can use these practices with Power BI in order to improve how data can be communicated to your end users in the best possible way making them come back over and over.

## Title: BI DevOps
 
**Abstract**:
If you are releasing new reports, cubes and/or SSIS packages on a regular basis, you've probably offered up your share of blood, toil, tears and sweat on getting them delivered into production in working condition.
DevOps is a way to bridge the gap between developers and IT professionals and for that we need to address the toolchain to support the practices. Microsoft offers a set of tools that'll help you on your journey towards the end goal: Maximize predictability, efficiency, security and maintainability of operational processes.

We will in detail be looking at:

SSIS/SSAS/SSRS
	Exceptions to the rule
Agile Development Frame of Mind
	Visual Studio Online (tool)
	Feature/PBI/WI (concept)
Team Foundation Server
	Code Branching (concept)
	Build Agents (tool)
PowerShell
	Microsoft's "Glue" (tool)

## Title: Always On Multi-Site Patterns
 
**Abstract**:
Building robust and resilient Data Platform solutions can be complex and costly, building out for both High Availability and Disaster Recovery. The Always On technologies incorporated in the Microsoft SQL Server stack help Data Platform Engineers to do just this. Creating solutions that span multiple locations, in an effort to protect the data that we are tasked to manage on a daily basis.

Together we will walk through the architecture patterns, technology requirements, and configuration options that you need to know in order to build a solid Data Platform. Understanding the implementation differences between on-premises and cloud based deployments is important. Especially as there are specific requirements that need to be met for up-time SLAs to be applicable, as well as mitigating for region failures.

All of these elements mean that it is more than just simple wizards to follow in order to have a solid, reliable, and robust SQL Server Data Platform.

## Title: Deep Learning as a Service with TensorFlow in Azure Machine Learning – an example from Elkjøp Nordic
 
**Abstract**:
Azure Machine Learning is Microsoft's go-to service for operationalizing machine learning models in the cloud. But can it do deep learning? The answer is yes! 

At Elkjøp Nordic, we use a neural network trained in TensorFlow and operationalized in Azure ML to sift through and categorize thousands of sentiment-classified customer feedback texts from our websites, allowing us to quickly measure how we are doing on major things like UX, checkout and payment, pinpoint areas where we need to improve, and more easily zero in on the important qualitative demands and wishes of our customers.

Deploying deep learning models into production is generally not trivial, and it's very common for machine learning projects with otherwise excellent results to be shelved before being put to practical business use. It doesn't have to be this way; I will show you how to jump this hurdle using the Data Science VM for model training, Blob Storage for... well, storage, and Azure ML for operationalization.

## Title: Power BI Admin. and Best Practices Implementation Techniques
 
**Abstract**:
Power BI is becoming more and more widely used in various organizations. As it’s adoption grows there

are a number of decisions and practices, which if made early in the process can prevent problems.

Attendees to this session will learn the best practice methods for administering Power BI from

visualization creation to deployment. These concepts will assist to provide a successful implementation

which will scale to be able to support large deployments. Learn how to balance the needs of creating an

environment for analyst to create visualizations while balancing the desires of the data team to provide

consistent single sources of the data for reporting.

Wondering what would be gained by adding Power BI Premier edition or whether or not you can

decrease the reporting cost footprint by using Power BI Report Server? Find out what criteria can be

used to provide a good fit.

This session will also cover an in-depth dive to the administration and security feature

## Title: T-SQL : Bad Habits and Best Practices
 
**Abstract**:
Whether you are a developer, DBA, or anything in between, chances are you might skip some best practices when you write T-SQL. Unfortunately, many so-called “bad habits” aren’t always obvious, but can lead to poor performance, maintainability issues, and compatibility problems.

In this session, you will learn about several bad habits, how they develop, and how you can avoid them. While we will briefly discuss advice you’ve probably heard before, like avoid SELECT * and be careful with NOLOCK, you will also learn some subtleties in SQL Server that might surprise you, how some shorthand can bite you in the long run, and a very easy way to improve cursor performance.

By changing your techniques and ditching some of these bad habits for best practices, you will take new techniques back to your environment that will lead to more efficient code, a more productive workflow, or both.

## Title: Getting CI right for SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
This isn't the dark ages any more. You've learned that you need to put your database in source control and you're competent with source control systems like TFS or Git. You've also learned how to express your database in script form using a tool like SSDT, Flyway or Redgate.
 
However, you still haven't written as many automated tests as you know you should and you aren't convinced you're going about it the right way. You haven't really looked at the build functionality in VSTS yet or gotten to grips with build servers like TeamCity or Jenkins, and even if you have you aren't sure how the process should work for SQL Server builds and tests.
 
In this session I'll talk through various ways to automate your database builds as well as how to use tSQLt to create a suite of automated tests, enabling you to spot problems early and giving you confidence in the quality of your code.

## Title: Entity Framework for the DBA
 
**Abstract**:
Entity Framework doesn't have the best reputation amongst DBAs, but the good news is it isn't inherently terrible; it's just very easy to get wrong.

In this session, we'll explore the mistakes which make Entity Framework stress SQL Server, and show how you can resolve them. We'll talk about how you can spot issues, either in production environments or during development. Finally we'll discuss ways of working with your development team to prevent these problems occurring in the first place.

You might not leave convinced that Entity Framework is a good idea, but you should go home with the understanding needed to get it running well on your systems.
