## Title: Make Your Maintenance Plans Better and Faster
 
**Abstract**:
Maintenance plans are never easy. They get worse as the databases get bigger and the maintenance windows shrink upon pressure from the customers. So, stop struggling with your nightly/weekly database maintenance plans. 
I am going share a case study of a three-terabyte database and how I tweaked my Indexing, backup and restore jobs to help cut down my maintenance window from over eight hours to under 30 minutes. By the end of my session you will be able to shrink the duration of your maintenance plans by as much as 75%. 
You will learn to use parameters like BLOCKSIZE, BUFFERCOUNT and MAXTRANSFERSIZE appropriately with the BACKUP command. You will also see the advantages of native database compression, striped, parallel and staggered backups in combination with a mix of Full/Differential and Log backups.
I will also show you how third party tools like Copy Data Virtualization or Snapshot Mirroring help us cut down our backup and restore times by as much as 95%.

## Title: BI Infrastructure in Azure: Points to Consider
 
**Abstract**:
Success of a good BI infrastructure is measured by two most important factors: 
a) Better access to data and 
b) Increased operational efficiency
How can you set up your own BI infrastructure in the cloud to address these? 
What components do we consider?
We can do that by proper selection of technology and vendors from Azure Market Place. How do we keep an eye on possible use of Big Data for your BI. We will also look at the best practices for doing so. We will take a fleeting look at some of the storage options for us in Azure and some Big Data concepts as well.
We will learn about Copy Data Virtualization in Azure Market Place that can help you provision terabytes worth of information in matter of minutes. 
We will also learn about setting up teams and ways to train them(and yourself) in this fast evolving world of Azure.

## Title: High Availability and Disaster Recovery for SQL Server in Azure IaaS
 
**Abstract**:
The CEO just tasked you with moving all the SQL Server instances to Azure, or maybe you are deploying a brand new application and want to leverage Azure IaaS to host SQL Server. Beyond security and performance, your most pressing concern might be ensuring SQL Server running in Azure is highly available.
 
While on-prem high availability and disaster recovery options for SQL Server are well defined, moving those instances to Azure immediately presents some questions and challenges. Can I simply lift and shift my SQL Server Failover Cluster Instance to the cloud? Do I need to upgrade to SQL Server Enterprise Edition and us Always On Availability Groups? What about shared storage and failover clustering? What about disaster recovery, what are my options there? Load Balancers, Fault Domains, Availability Zones, Azure Site Recovery and Region Pairs, what are these things and why do they matter to me? 

Cloud  Datacenter MVP David Bermingham takes explains all this and more in the session.

## Title: Self-Service ETL with Power Query
 
**Abstract**:
Before any significant data analysis can take place the data often needs to be transformed, aggregated, and combined. This is often referred to as the ETL (Extraction, Transform, and Load) process. Power Query is an excellent tool in the Microsoft self-service BI stack that allows business users to discover, combine, and refine data before loading it into a Power Pivot model for further analysis. In addition, Microsoft has made connecting to a wide variety of sources including relational, structured, and semi structured data a consistent intuitive experience. This session guides you through using Power Query to extract, transform, and load data from various sources into a Power Pivot model. In addition, we will look at the M language created by the tool and look at some advanced queries you can create using M.

## Title: Effective Data Warehouse Storage Patterns
 
**Abstract**:
Many companies start off with a simple data mart for reporting. As the company grows, users become dependent on the data mart for monitoring and making decisions on Key Performance Indicators (KPI).

Unexpected information growth in your data mart may lead to a performance impacted reporting system. In short, your users will be lining up at your cube for their daily reports.

How do you reduce the size of your data mart and speed up data retrieval?  This presentation will review the following techniques to fix your woes.

Techniques:
1 – What is horizontal partitioning?
2 – Database sharding for daily information.
3 – Working with files and file groups.
3 – Partitioned views for performance.
4 – Table and Index partitions.
5 – Row Data Compression.
6 – Page Data Compression.
7 – Programming a sliding window.
8 – What is different in Azure SQL database?

## Title: Data Profiling or Statistics 201
 
**Abstract**:
Any new database design, normalization process or just simple research starts from data profiling. At first you determine number of rows in the data set. After that you run multiple similar queries against each column to determine Max and Min values, maximum length for text columns, number of nulls, distribution of data, and more.
When all these queries are already pre-set or dynamic or you are doing profiling via SQL Server Data Tools, it is not a problem on relatively small data set, but what if your table contains billions of records, and stretches for multiple gigabytes? All queries against that large data set will do a full table scan, which will produce very heavy I/O, and take forever.
In order to make the process faster, we will use a hidden gem of SQL Server:  Statistics. Only one table scan will be needed to generate them, and then we can use the science behind them to do research over our data.

## Title: Entrepreneurship - Are you ready to make it on your own?
 
**Abstract**:
There's no doubt about it, being an entrepreneur can be very rewarding. However, it is far from easy. So, before you embark on that journey, you have to ask yourself if this is the right thing for you to do. But, how do you know?

Attend this inspiring session by Prof Joe Wehr of the MCCC and discover the good and the bad of becoming an entrepreneur. 

This includes the things everyone needs to know, like
- how to strategize and create a business plan
- how to secure financing
- what to look out for before hiring (hiring mistakes are very costly)

And the less obvious, including
- knowing when and how to get out (retirement, anybody?)
- the not so subtle difference between a consultant and an entrepreneur (this is an eye-opener)
- how to legally extend the reach of your cash (ever heard of multitasking your money?)

If you have been thinking about “it” but aren't sure if you're ready, you need to attend this session. You might be surprised by what you learn about yourself

## Title: Staging data for Azure SQL services
 
**Abstract**:
Most companies are faced with the ever-growing big data problem.  There have been two schools of thought on how to solve this problem.

Schema on write is represented by the traditional relational database table. Only a small portion of the total data owned by the company resides in the database.

Schema on read is represented by technologies such as Hadoop or PolyBase. All data owned by the company can reside in simple storage.

Today, we will learn how to stage data using Azure blob storage which can be ingested by both techniques.

1 – Grab some big data.
2 – Create blob storage account.
3 – Copy data to container.
4 – Azure SQL database plumbing.
5 – Loading data with BULK INSERT.
6 – Azure SQL data warehouse plumbing.
7 – Loading data with POLYBASE.
8 – Azure automation with RUNBOOKS.

## Title: Introduction to the R Programming Language for BI Professionals
 
**Abstract**:
The modern BI professional is taking on the challenge of operationalizing data science. Most BI developers are very strong in TSQL but their exposer to advanced statistics and visualizations were limited by what is available in the TSQL language. The R programming language allows us to clean, visualize, and apply advanced statistical methods to data. 

In this session I will demonstrate how to use R Studio to generate and test R scripts; generate R visuals in PowerBI; call R code in machine learning workflows; and execute R code in SQL Server. Additionally, I will cover these R programming fundamentals: creating and assigning variables; performing simple calculations; understanding R data types; vectors; matrices; factors; lists; data frames; and ggplot2 graphics.

## Title: Advanced T-SQL Development with latest features.
 
**Abstract**:
In the last releases,  SQL Server development was enriched with new T-SQL features, such as STRING_AGG, STRING_SPLIT, TRANSLATE array of Ranking and Windowing functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, TILE), MERGE statement, OUTPUT clause, EXCEPT and INTERSECT just to name a few. For various reasons some DBA/Developers do not utilize these new features. In this session, the audience will see demonstrations of the different practical use cases where these features can make T-SQL coding more efficient. This 100% code-based demo session highlights efficiency to utilize the latest T-SQL functions over conventional methods with the same functionality. The session will cover in depth live scenarios where these features have proven performance efficiency, code re

## Title: Build a White/Blacklist Bouncer. Who Gets into Your SQL Club?
 
**Abstract**:
Are too many systems hitting your SQL Servers? Do you know who they all are? Are you under attack?
When it comes to this type of problem the consensus is to get with your network and domain admins to adequately configure access options. 
What happens when you can't wait or don't even have folks in that role to get the configuration right? 

A blacklist is a list of what cannot access something you are trying to protect. (Like the TSA no-fly list. If you are on the list, you are not getting anywhere fast.)

A whitelist is just the opposite. It is a list of what is permitted to access something. If whatever is attempting access is not on the list, it isn’t getting in.
In this session, we will go through the process to create and test your own SQL based whitelists and blacklists and also take a look at how whitelisting is being used in SQL 2017 to control what CLR objects can be trusted to run in your environment.

## Title: The Anatomy of Select
 
**Abstract**:
TSQL is one of the most valuable tools any SQL Server professional can add to their tool-set. More aptly, TSQL is a whole chest of tools for the SQL Server professional. One of the most important tools in that TSQL chest is a good understanding of the SELECT statement.

When was the last time you sat down to evaluate a SELECT statement? What actually goes into the processing of that teeny little word? There might be a fair bit more to this simple term than just fetching data from the database. This session covers the simplicity of the select. Then we take it a step further to dive into some of the complexities tied directly to this particular statement.

This session will help the attendee better understand the Select statement. With a more solid understanding of this statement, the attendee can return and implement some of this new knowledge to help improve processing and query response times in their own environments.

The Enterprise Edition of SQL Server 2016 contains 2 powerful features for database and data warehouse developers to improve performance and scalability. One is columnstore indexes and the other is in-memory optimized tables. In this presentation I'll show several examples with large databases on how you can get the most out of these 2 great features. I'll cover the scenarios and contexts where columnstore indexes and in-memory optimizes tables work best.
