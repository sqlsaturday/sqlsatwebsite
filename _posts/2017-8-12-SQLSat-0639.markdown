## Title: Columnstore Indexes with SQL Server 2016
 
**Abstract**:
The columnstore index is the standard for storing and querying large data warehousing fact tables. It uses column-based data storage and query processing to achieve up to 10x query performance gains in your data warehouse over traditional row-oriented storage, and up to 10x data compression over the uncompressed data size. Beginning with SQL Server 2016, columnstore indexes enable operational analytics, the ability to run performant real-time analytics on a transactional workload. 

In this session, you will learn all about columnstore indexes and how to start taking advantage of this technology to achieve true real-time analytics.
