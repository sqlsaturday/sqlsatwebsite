## Title: A Dynamic World Demands Dynamic SQL
 
**Abstract**:
Dynamic SQL is a misunderstood and much maligned part of a DBA’s tool kit – it can be used to solve difficult business problems, respond to diverse data needs, and alleviate performance problems. Many DBAs reject dynamic SQL outright as a potential source of SQL injections, being poorly performing, or just for being a hacky solution in general.

Jeremiah Peschka has been making extensive use of dynamic SQL throughout his career to solve a variety of problems. He’ll set about dispelling these misconceptions and demonstrate how dynamic SQL can become a part of every DBA’s tool kit.

Learn how to work effectively with diverse inputs.
Learn how to avoid common pitfalls of dynamic SQL.
Develop an understanding of real world uses for dynami

## Title: Intro to WCF Data Services and OData
 
**Abstract**:
Exposing your data to client applications is a common requirement across most applications; however, there are many ways to accomplish this.  Each application seems to implement it a different way which leads to inconsistency across your application spectrum.  With the release of the .NET Framework 3.5, Microsoft has introduced WCF Data Services (was ADO.NET Data Services) which is a collection of classes and standards to allow you to expose your data consistently and securely to your client applications.  We'll focus on WCF Data Services in .NET 4, in which Microsoft has beefed up the offering, and also the data protocol known as OData.

## Title: Wait-Time Based SQL Server Performance Management
 
**Abstract**:
Using Wait Time Analysis and Wait Types is a newer method for tuning SQL Server instances. As a result, there is often confusion on exactly what the data means. The issue typically centers around the fact the wait time data is analyzed at the wrong level or the collected wait time data is not detailed enough. This presentation will focus on these problems and review several real-life case studies of using SQL Server Wait Type data coupled with Wait-Time based performance analysis to solve the most difficult performance related issues.
