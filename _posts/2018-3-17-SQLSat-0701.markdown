## Title: SQL Server Transactional Replication: A Deeper Dive
 
**Abstract**:
Transactional replication in SQL Server is not a new, shiny technology. In fact, a lot of people will tell you it's an old one full of nightmares. But don't be too quick to judge; replication still offers a lot of benefits, and  most of the problems you might encounter can be quickly diagnosed and fixed if you have a deeper understanding of replication internals.

In this session, we'll discuss the transactional replication model and what it offers. You'll see plenty of examples of how to monitor transactions as they get from your publishers to your subscribers. There will also be examples of how you can change the behavior of your transactions too, and what benefits (and potential pitfalls) these changes offer.

Finally, you'll see examples on how to configure transactional replication in high availability scenarios.

## Title: DevOps for the DBA
 
**Abstract**:
DevOps came out of the Agile movement and the idea that operations needed to be part of the solution for agile development to be successful.  The DBA was often the most resilient and robust member of the operations team and most resistant to change.  This mentality was essential to the protection of company’s critical production data.

This session discusses common database challenges and how they can be minimized or solved with newer DevOps practices without impacting the DBAs “safe zone”.  We’ll discuss how to use these vital skills and motivate everyone towards solutions for more success in agile development environments. Development, testing, provisioning, patching, upgrading and managing will become easier with agile tools, virtualization and collaboration.  
The take-aways from this session are to embrace DevOps basics with a “DBA twist” such as:
-What DevOps means to the DBA
-What tools and methodologies are important to know
-The future skills you need to build your career

## Title: SQL Server and PowerShell: Let's Get Serious
 
**Abstract**:
Whether you’ve dabbled in PowerShell or wondered what all the fuss is about, make no mistake: PowerShell isn’t going away. It is definitely something worth learning to make your life as a SQL Server professional easier, and allow you to advance in your career as a DBA.

In this session, you’ll see practical, real-world examples of how you can blend SQL Server and PowerShell together. You’ll also get a look at the SQL Server PowerShell provider and how you can incorporate it into your automation scripts.

Instead of focusing on syntax, the session will plunge straight into examples and highlight various snippets of code and how they work. You can expect to see code examples on how PowerShell can do anything from comparing tables across servers, automating and centralizing your backups, and even doing in-depth security audits.

## Title: Why should I care about ... the plan cache?
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this installment of Rick's "Why should I care" series, he lays out a case for why working knowledge of the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments. A review of relevant views and functions is included for the (newly?) motivated audience.

Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why their DBAs drink in the morning (allegedly). This is not a deep dive into the cache, it really is primarily a session exploring _why_ these DMOs are worth slogging through.

## Title: Stream Analytics for a SQL Developer
 
**Abstract**:
As database developers, we are very familiar with patterns and practices of analyzing data at rest – data that has been loaded into our databases and data warehouses and that allows us to learn what happened a few hours, days or months ago. Yet, we often encounter the need to know and respond to what is happening right now, which requires near-real-time analysis of data in motion.

Fortunately, much of the skillset that we have accumulated in querying data at rest can be applied in querying streaming data with the Azure Stream Analytics service. In this demo-rich session, you will learn the essential architecture and patterns of building streaming analytics solutions and will be introduced to the Stream Analytics Query Language.

## Title: Performance in 60 Seconds – SQL Tricks Everybody MUST Know
 
**Abstract**:
Data and Database is a very important aspect of application development for businesses. Developers often come across situations where they face a slow server response, even though their hardware specifications are above par. This session is for all the Developers who want their server to perform at blazing fast speed, but want to invest very little time to make it happen. We will go over various database tricks which require absolutely no time to master and require practically no SQL coding at all. After attending this session, Developers will only need 60 seconds to improve performance of their database server in their implementation. We will have a quiz during the session to keep the conversation alive. Developers will walk out with scripts and knowledge that can be applied to their servers, immediately post the session.

## Title: Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere - Straight from the Source
 
**Abstract**:
Over the years, virtualization has matured from the exotic black magic realm to become a mainstream standard IT practice. quot;Virtualize Firstquot; is now a well-accepted default practice in most enterprises and any deviation is now considered an anomaly. In spite of this trend, many IT administrators and architects still have some reservations about virtualizing SQL Server workloads. They consider SQL too quot;criticalquot; to be virtualized; they wonder and worry about scale about performance; they are looking for guidance and reassurance. If this is where you (or your clients) are today, be sure to attend this session. You will gain valuable insights from what others have done to successfully undertake similar tasks in their environments. We will talk about configuration pitfalls to avoid and also review the configuration and current performance data for some of the most demanding applications in customers environments. Got an SQL virtualization or performance question? Bring i

## Title: How to Build Your Disaster Recovery Plan
 
**Abstract**:
So your boss asked for a copy of your DR plan.  Once you've wiped that deer-in-the-headlights look off your face, you realize "We've got database backups," isn't exactly a plan.  You need to come up with a plan to recover your business when disaster strikes. This session will help you build this plan by defining what a disaster could be, documenting the business impact, and identifying your limitations.  We will show how to use this information to establish metrics (such as RTO and RPO), document current recovery configurations, and design an effective recovery strategy that meets the needs and budget of your business. Attending this session will give you the knowledge and tools to create an effective disaster recovery plan that will make your boss happy and ensure the continuity of your business.

## Title: Let Her Finish: Supporting Women's Voices in Technology
 
**Abstract**:
Next time you attend a meeting, watch what happens when women at the table offer ideas. If your office is like most in America, you’ll notice women are interrupted almost three times as often as men. Some interruptions are to assert dominance but sometimes people do it to be helpful  offer affirmation. Regardless of the intent, the results are the same. Women are being left out of the conversation. The consequences are real. Male executives that speak more frequently in meetings are rewarded with 10% higher competence ratings from peers  better performance reviews from bosses. This translates into $ when raises and bonuses are handed out.
 This discussion will cover positive solutions that help women’s voices be heard. Women need to be more assertive. We need to learn to say “Stop interrupting me.” and “I just said that.” However, men can be, no HAVE to be, part of the solution. They can help women become part of the conversation.

## Title: Secrets of SQL Server - Database Worst Practices
 
**Abstract**:
“Oh! What did I do?” Chances are you have heard, or even uttered, this expression. This demo-oriented session will show many examples where database professionals were dumbfounded by their own mistakes, and could even bring back memories of your own early DBA days. The goal of this session is to expose the small details that can be dangerous to the production environment and SQL Server as a whole, as well as talk about worst practices and how to avoid them. In this session we will focus on some of the common errors and their resolution. Developers will walk out with scripts and knowledge that can be applied to their servers, immediately post the session.

## Title: Analysis Services for the Absolute Beginner
 
**Abstract**:
Publications across the globe have called “data the new oil.”  However, the value of oil is what the oil can be turned into.  Similarly, the value in data is in what you derive from it, not the data itself.

Regardless of the title you carry, DBA, developer, report writer, ETL developer, manager etc., now is the time to make an acquaintance of Analysis Services.  Come, join in as we define basic terms, investigate a few uses cases and see some simple examples.  You will soon see that if data is the new oil, Analysis Services, on-premises or in the cloud, is a key component in the new refinery.

## Title: Build Your Extract Packages Automatically!
 
**Abstract**:
Automating extract packages is trivial., you simply use INFORMATION_SCHEMA.  The problem is not all your data sources have easy to read metadata like SQL Server.  How do you create usable metadata from these sources? In this hour, I’ll show you how easy it is to make an educated guess on the schema of flat files and other “semi-structured” data sources.  

With that schema, automatically generating your extract package is a matter of seconds!  Join me while I share my interrogator project with you and start saving hours at work today!

## Title: R-ternatives in Power BI
 
**Abstract**:
R is a very powerful statistical programming language that has been gaining a lot of traction in recent years. In early 2015 Microsoft acquired Revolution Analytics, a major provider of software and services for R. Microsoft have since incorporated R in Azure ML, SQL Server 2016, and Power BI. 

There are 3 ways you can leverage R in Power BI. You can use it as a data source, you can leverage it in Power Query, or you can use it to create custom visualizations. In this session I present easy to follow examples of those 3 scenarios. I will also provide resources that will enable you to take what you learned to the next level.
