## Title: MICROSOFT: SQL Server 2016 Stretch Database 
 
**Abstract**:
Your cold data growth is getting out of control, storage consumption is increasing faster than your budget, your end-users won't (or can't) tell you what can delete or truncate, but they demand their cold or archived data always be online and available. Now you have tables so big that you dread re-indexing, and you have to look for ever more creative solutions to manage this data, while still remaining compliant.
#160;
There’s a solution that lets you take advantage of the Cloud, on your terms, all without impacting your existing end-user applications or queries.
#160;
Come find out how you can move your data securely and transparently, free up disc space and reduce your enterprise storage consumption, while retaining full control from the on-premises SQL Server. You’ll reduce maintenance operations time and resources, plus lower overall cost. Learn how SQL Server Stretch database will simplify your journey to the Cloud!

## Title: Supercharge Your Maintenance Plans!
 
**Abstract**:
Today’s SQL Server DBA has a myriad of options when it comes to implementing their backup and maintenance strategies.  From internal maintenance plans to all-encompassing third-party solutions, the options are practically endless.  One very popular solution revolves around a set of free scripts provided by Swedish data scientist, Ola Hallengren.  These well admired scripts are used by corporations large and small worldwide in order to facilitate backups, integrity checks, and index maintenance operations.

In this session, not only will we introduce these scripts to those unfamiliar with them, but just as importantly, we’ll take a detailed look into just how these scripts can be extended and customized even further.  You’ll be amazed at the flexibility offered by the optional parameters.  We’ll also take a gander into the remarkably detailed logging tables in order to inspect the raw data and possibly turn it into a valuable reporting data source.

## Title: Data Partitioning for Database Architects and Mere Mortals
 
**Abstract**:
Data partitioning is an essential technique that simplifies database administration tasks, improves system availability and reduces the cost of the solution. Contrary to popular belief, data partitioning is not limited to partitioned tables and the Enterprise Edition of SQL Server.

This session demonstrates the data partitioning techniques available in the various editions of SQL Server. It discusses benefits, downsides and the best use-cases for partition tables, local and distributed partitioned views and stretch databases. The session will also demonstrate how data partitioning helps boost performance of systems handling a mixed workload, improves cardinality estimations with large tables, and reduces the system’s storage cost. 

Finally, the session provides a set of guidelines on how to split the data between relational and non-relational storages in OLTP and IoT systems hosted in the Cloud.

## Title: Planning and Executing a Successful SQL Server Database Migration
 
**Abstract**:
Migrating an existing database to SQL Server requires much more than just moving the schema and data.  They key to a successful database migration effort includes designing the target system, identifying all components from the existing system that will need to be migrated, and allowing adequate time for changes and testing. 

In this session we will discuss all the different database components and configuration items that will need to be considered during the migration effort, how to utilize the SQL Server Migration Assistant as a planning and implementation tool, what components cannot be migrated (and what can be done about it),  and pitfalls to avoid during the development, testing, and final implementation.

## Title: Power BI Data Governance - Protecting Business Data
 
**Abstract**:
This session allows companies to think about the security and architecture of their Power BI deployment. Power BI is self service analytics. Users are quick to create a group work spaces without any thought. IT and organizations need to design a business friendly architecture that protects the business data without impacting the users ability to build their reports and dashboards. Users are also quick to change the data model or report without thinking of the negative impact. A strategy for delivering the changes needs to be put into place. This prevents presenting invalid reports or dashboards during the development or advancement stage of updating reports and dashboards.

## Title: Revenge: The SQL!
 
**Abstract**:
Pop quiz DBA: Your developers are running rampant in production. Logic, reason, and threats have all failed. You're on the edge. What do you do? WHAT DO YOU DO?

Hint: You attend Revenge: The SQL! 

This session will show you how to "correct" all those bad practices. Everyone logging in as sa? Running huge cursors? Using SELECT * and ad-hoc SQL? Stop them dead, without actually killing them. Ever dropped a table, or database, or WHERE clause? You can prevent that! And if you’re tired of folks ignoring your naming conventions, make them behave with Unicode…and take your revenge!

Revenge: The SQL! is fun and educational and may even have some practical use, but you’ll want to attend simply to indulge your Dark Side. Revenge: The SQL! assumes no liability and is not available in all 50 states. Do not taunt Revenge: The SQL! or Happy Fun Ball.

## Title: Unit Testing SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
In the nearly 20 years I have been working with SQL Server, most of that as an independent consultant, I can count on two hands the number of clients I have come across that had ANY database tests constructed.  I can count on TWO FINGERS the number of them that had repeatable database tests.  Even the most ardent Agile/Scrum/pick-your-new-and-shiny-development-mantra shops hardly ever do anything more than wave a magic wand at testing the database, because it can be REALLY HARD to do and do correctly.  In this session we will cover examples of why repeatable database testing is CRITICALLY important and then examine both a free and a low-cost commercial product to ease the pain and improve developer efficiency.

## Title: Making Database Development and Deployments Easier With SQL Server Data Too
 
**Abstract**:
Tooling for database development and deployment is often a cause for frustration. Developers don't like using Management Studio because it's an administrative tool that doesn't offer the full Visual Studio experience. DBAs want an automated, consistent, and reliable way to deploy changes without having to write custom scripts every time. Enter SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT), a free set of tools from Microsoft that spans all phases of the database lifecycle from development to deployment while relieving both Developer and DBA pain along the way. In this introductory level session you'll learn what SSDT it, how it works, and how to implement it in your environment.

My passion is to deliver end to end data driven solutions that enable our customers to have a 'edge' over their competitors.
