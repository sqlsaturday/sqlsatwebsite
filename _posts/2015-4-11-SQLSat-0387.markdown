## Title: Right-Sizing Your SQL Server Virtual Machine
 
**Abstract**:
Virtualizing your top-tier production SQL Servers is not as easy as P2V’ing it. Sometimes allocating more resources to the VM is the wrong approach, and getting it wrong will silently hurt performance. What is the most effective method for determining the ‘right’ amount of resources to allocate? What happens if the workload changes a month from now?

The methods for understanding the performance of your mission-critical SQL Servers gathered over the past ten years of SQL Server virtualization will be addressed, and valuable processes for performance statistic collection and analysis will be displayed. Come learn how to properly ‘right-size’ the resources allocated to a VM, improve the performance of your SQL Servers, and keep it maximized well into the future.

## Title: Getting Top Performance from SQL Reporting Service
 
**Abstract**:
You’re a DBA at your company, and you’re in charge of keeping the production SQL servers humming. You know how to maintain and troubleshoot those instances for top performance. But now your boss has given you a new task: find out why the company reports are running so slowly and why the server itself seems unresponsive at times.

In this session we’ll talk about how to get the best performance from your SQL reporting server. We will discuss how to administer a SQL Server Reporting Service (SSRS) instance; how to install and configure the service for best performance, how to see what reports are currently running, and find which reports are bogging down the server. 

This session will not cover report design scaling out, or SSRS for SharePoint.

## Title: Keeping the "Business" in Business Intelligence
 
**Abstract**:
It is no accident the term “Business Intelligence” starts with “Business.” Any Business Intelligence initiative should, likewise, start with the needs of the Business. For many years, BI was seen as a technology project. This is one reason why so many BI initiatives fail. Rather than a Technology Project, BI is a Business Program. It must grow and evolve as the Business grows an evolves. 

In this session, we will discuss the following:
-- Why BI is a worthwhile investment (using case study examples)
-- What criteria to use in determining the success of a BI initiative
-- Several reasons why BI initiatives fail
-- Critical Success Factors for BI

So much of the success for BI happens before the requirements are even gathered. Come learn how you can set yourself up for success with Business Intelligence.

## Title: Somebody got BIDS Helper in my Data Tools
 
**Abstract**:
Do you develop SSIS packages, SSRS reports or SSAS models (multidimensional or tabular)? Then this session is for you! We'll cover the capabilities this free tool provides as well as address some of the grating little quirks of BIDS/SSDT. Learn how to get a roles report or printer-friendly dimension usage from Analysis Services Multidimensional. Regain missing functionality in SSAS Tabular such as drillthrough actions, display folders, and HideMemberIf.  Delete dataset cache files in SSRS to work around an annoying “feature”. Extend your SSIS capabilities: deploy packages from BIDS/SSDT, identify items with configuration/expressions, create packages based on templates, and find differences between packages. Learn about this perfect combination from Meagan Longoria and Bill Fellows and you'll never want to have your BIDS without the Helper again.

## Title: Do More With Less: SQL Central Management Server and SQL Agent Multi-Server Administration
 
**Abstract**:
Two of the of the most under-utilized management features of SQL Server are the Central Management Server and the SQL Agent Multi-Server Administration tools. The CMS is a powerful little tool creates a catalog of servers that allows you to execute any query or script against multiple servers at the same time. The SQL Agent Multi-Server Administration (MSX) tool allows you to create a SQL Agent job on one server and then deploy it to multiple servers instantly. When used in conjunction with each other, you have a powerful set of features that make managing your enterprise a lot simpler. 

SQL Server MVP Mike Hillwig will show you how to to deploy these two powerful features right out of the box without writing a single line of new code.

## Title: Power Query: Data Chemistry for the Masses
 
**Abstract**:
ETL Developers have being doing chemistry with data for years in tools like SQL Server Integration Services. These tools require training, experience, and time that few business users have. But in the age of self-service BI, those business users need a way to shape data to support their analysis.

This session will show how Power Query can be easily used to take advantage of data's properties to drive the change we need to support our goals.

We will discuss/demonstrate:
-- The simple process of accessing a wide variety of data sources
-- The ease with which simple transformations can be achieved using the Power Query Ribbon
-- Power Query's fantastic ability to travel through time to see every step taken with the data
-- The foundations of the Power Query Formula Language, informally known as "M"
-- Using "M" to take Power Query WAY beyond what the Ribbon has to offer.

Come learn about what may well be the most exciting member of the Power BI family.

## Title: Pseudo-Constants in SQL
 
**Abstract**:
You know you’ve done it. Maybe it was the lucky number 7. Maybe it was an enigmatic X. Maybe you smooshed some words together in ALLCAPS. That should be easier to spot, right? Because some day you might need to change it—in every stored procedure, function, and view.

Magic numbers, codes, identifiers, constants, enumerations. Whatever you call them, all applications have them. Sure it’s quick and easy to sprinkle the values throughout your code, but that breeds mistakes, rigidity, and obfuscation. There has to be a better way!

Other languages give us real constants and enums—with IntelliSense and compilation-level enforcement. Well guess what-- SQL Server does too, sort of. Join us and learn to write clearer, easier to maintain code without sacrificing performance.

## Title: An Introduction To Resource Governor in SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Do you have multiple databases with distinct workloads running on a single SQL Server Enterprise Edition instance? Have you ever had a runaway process or bad query from one system bring an entire instance to its knees, impacting a wide range of end users? If you answered yes to either of these questions, then come learn about Resource Governor for SQL Server. We’ll spend the first part of this introductory session going over the concepts you will need to know in order to implement Resource Governor successfully. Once we've covered the basics, we’ll spend the rest of the session working through a number of demos, reviewing exciting enhancements to Resource Governor in SQL Server 2014, and discussing scenarios in which you can use Resource Governor in your environment right away. Hardware resources are a valuable commodity.  Learn how you can control them effectively in a multitenant environment, ensuring they are assigned where they need to be.

## Title: Twice in a Lifetime: T-SQL Refactoring 101
 
**Abstract**:
Whether it's because you inherited the code from the "last guy," or your stored procedures haven't been looked at since the database was created in 2001, there will come a time when you need to rewrite old code. When you start this project you may ask yourself, how did I get here? And you may ask yourself, how do I work this? This is not my beautiful database. This is not my beautiful T-SQL. Letting the data go by, information flowing to the end users is the goal. Refactoring old code can be tedious, but necessary. Sometimes it isn't just about identifying the worst queries in your application, but figuring out how to rewrite everything to introduce the best practices that the last guy didn't know about five years ago. 

This session will cover ways to quickly find old T-SQL antipatterns, tools that can help make things easier to update code, and deprecated features that can't be used in modern versions of SQL Server. Don't leave your old T-SQL the same as it ever was.
