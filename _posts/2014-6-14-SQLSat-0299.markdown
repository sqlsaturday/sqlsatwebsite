## Title: Full life-cycle of Self-Service BI with PowerPivot and the SSAS Tabular Model
 
**Abstract**:
Within the enterprise, the new Excel self-service tools can enable Power Users to define and create analytic requirements by creating new business models in PowerPivot. We will walk through a scenario of creating relationships, hierarchies, KPIs, calculations, and measures as a business person.  When completed we will hand it off the model to the governance board for review to see how it fits into the organization BI collateral.  Finally, we will put on our IT hats and convert the PowerPivot model into a SSAS Tabular version and give it enterprise strength of partitions and security.  We will end the session by selecting a deployment strategy that will meet the needs of new and existing models in the production environment.

## Title: Performance Tuning - Analyzing Execution Plans
 
**Abstract**:
Did you ever get woken up at night from a call from a user screaming about poor query performance, but didn’t really know how to begin attack the problem?  In this session, we will explore the basics of execution plan analysis and how to single out issues that pertain to base table operations.
In this presentation, we will identify what indexes are being used by the SQL Optimizer, the different type of index operations that are performed by SQL Server and which operations are generally considered the preferred method of data retrieval. We will discuss how to determine if the indexes used by the Optimizer are optimal, according to best practices, and the exceptions to those cases.   Finally, we will cover the relationships between different types of index operations and joins within SQL Server, including how the SQL Optimizer determines which join type it will use, along with the pros and cons of each join operation

## Title: Geekin’ Out on Extended Events -Deconstructing the system_health session to solve performance issues
 
**Abstract**:
Extended Events are used to gather a wide range of performance information to help troubleshoot performance problems in SQL Server. The system_health session is an Extended Events session that is included by default with SQL Server. This session starts automatically when the SQL Server database engine starts, and runs without any noticeable performance effects. This presentations will take you on an in-depth tour of the data provided in the system_health event session and how to use it to troubleshoot performance issues. Cases studies from real-life examples will be used to demonstrate tips and tricks.

## Title: SSIS Templates Can Make Your Life Easier
 
**Abstract**:
How many times have you started a new SSIS project and added the same components that you’ve added to almost every other package you’ve created?  Components to handle logging and errors or even a standard workflow for loading data files.  In this session I’ll show you how you can create standard templates that already contain any and all of the common components you desire.  We’ll also look at how to implement and use these templates so that the next time you create a SSIS package you can spend your time on the work you actually need to do instead of implementing common components over and over again.

## Title: From 0 to Hadoop
 
**Abstract**:
Heard about BigData and Hadoop and want to make some sense of it? You will learn about what Hadoop is and what is it not, and how it can help your organization. We will cover Microsoft HDInsight as a cloud solution and Hortonworks HDP 2.0 as an onsite platform for Hadoop implementations. Takeaways include: Why you might want to consider onsite vs hosted, and how to get up to speed as fast as possible on this game changing technology.

## Title: APPLY Yourself
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft introduced the APPLY operator in SQL Server 2005. This under-used, non-standard operator can help us solve a number of common (and not-so-common) problems with elegant code which performs well. We will look several problem spaces in which the APPLY operator shines, such as joining to table-valued functions, getting the top N child records for each parent record, string splitting, and word matching. With the use of these examples, we will gain a deeper understanding of when to use the APPLY operator.

## Title: SQL Audit - auditing doesn't have to be boring
 
**Abstract**:
Let's face it, auditing isn't fun. But if you're a DBA, you need to know what's going on in your SQL Server instance. Fortunately, SQL Audit makes it easy. In this session, we'll cover what you can and can't audit using SQL Audit, enhancements in 2012, configuring database and server audits, ways to process output, and ideas for how to implement SQL Audit on a larger scale. Auditing doesn't have to be hard. And with the help of a little custom coding, it can even be fun.

**Abstract**:
There are a plethora of regulatory compliance mandates that affect business today with names like Sarbanes-Oxley, PCI-DSS, and HIPAA. How does a database professional implement these controls in your SQL Server infrastructure? We will review the basics of the GRC (Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance) methodology. You will learn about the tools that you can use to achieve compliance such as TDE, Auditing, and Identity Management. Come to this session and learn how to build a compliant infrastructure that keeps the DBA team, the auditors and the business leaders happy.

## Title: Tally 'Em Up
 
**Abstract**:
Database administrators as a rule hate Row-By-Agonizing-Row (RBAR) solutions due to how poorly they perform in T-SQL. Sometimes, though, it seems as though we need to make do and take that performance hit. This presentation will show you that the humble tally table can eliminate RBAR-dependency across a number of different problem spaces, including splitting text, validating dates, and even reporting on errors. With plenty of examples, you'll get to see exactly how powerful a tally table can be.

## Title: Unit Testing SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
In the nearly 20 years I have been working with SQL Server, most of that as an independent consultant, I can count on two hands the number of clients I have come across that had ANY database tests constructed.  I can count on TWO FINGERS the number of them that had repeatable database tests.  Even the most ardent Agile/Scrum/pick-your-new-and-shiny-development-mantra shops hardly ever do anything more than wave a magic wand at testing the database, because it can be REALLY HARD to do and do correctly.  In this session we will cover examples of why repeatable database testing is CRITICALLY important and then examine both a free and a low-cost commercial product to ease the pain and improve developer efficiency.

## Title: Transactional Replication-10 steps for successful implementation
 
**Abstract**:
What is potentially our biggest problem with transactional replication? You guessed it...it breaks! It may break for a variety of reasons and we as DBA’s probably have experienced them all at one point or another. Our biggest worry? Bringing replication back online whenever a full snapshot reinitialization is not an option due to time or space concerns. But don't you worry; we have a couple of tricks up our sleeves! During this session, we will go over options available to you to re-sync your replication with minimal downtime for your production environments.
