## Title: Performance for SMB Developers - 2011
 
**Abstract**:
Is performance still important today, with powerful systems and storage, especially in small and medium business environments? The popular concept “code reuse” misinterpreted in SQL has catastrophic consequences.  The cost based optimizer, a cornerstone of modern database engines, can lead to seriously bad execution plans. The immense power of modern system is distribute of many processors cores. The database must be designed for scalable parallel execution plans to benefit from modern system architecture. Finally, random IO performance appears to be solved with SSD. Well, now it is time to admit that there are CPU elements of disk IO that are not solved by SSD storage with immense IOPS capability.

## Title: Microsoft Data Mining Fundamentals
 
**Abstract**:
In the book, Data Mining with Microsoft SQL Server 2008, the author defines data mining as “the process of analyzing data to find hidden patterns using automatic methodologies”. In this session, we will look at what data mining is and what are some advantages of using it.  We will also take a look at what data mining can do for you by reviewing some of the problems that it can be used to address and the cost of implementing it. I will demonstrate how easy it is to use SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) and Business Intelligence Development Studio (BIDS) to build and analyze models using existing data.

Hasani Holder is a software engineer at Teleios Systems with 3 years working on the MessageCentral team. My primary usage of SQL Server is to store and retrieve messaging transaction data however I also perform analysis on that data to find patterns, trends and anomolies. Recently I've been toying with Microsoft Data Mining to improve that analysis.
