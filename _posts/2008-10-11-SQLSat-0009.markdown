## Title: Using Data Profiling to Improve ETL
 
**Abstract**:
Data quality is one of the most challenging aspects of constructing a reliable data warehouse / business intelligence solution. SQL Server Integration Services 2008 introduces the Data Profiling Task, which can be used to help improve the data quality in the ETL process itself. This session will cover the use of the Data Profiling Task to gather initial quality metrics from both source systems and the warehouse. It will also cover how to incorporate data profiling into the ongoing ETL process to continue gathering quality metrics on new data, and to build dynamic data quality rules that adjust themselves based on the current quality measures.

## Title: Patterns for SSIS Configurations
 
**Abstract**:
One of the common issues encountered with SSIS is deploying configurations for multiple environments. During this session, 3 patterns for handling configurations in SSIS will be covered. from a simple pattern that handles most cases, to a very flexible pattern that covers most complex scenarios. Learning and using these patterns will allow SSIS developers to more easily deploy packages between environments, and leverage a single point of configuration in each environment.

## Title: SQL Server 2005 Auditing Using the CLR
 
**Abstract**:
Database auditing is something everyone would like their databases to do, but implementing it without slowing data access down can be difficult.  In this session I will show you how to use the CLR to create triggers that do not have a big performance hit and do not have to be rewritten if the tables change.
