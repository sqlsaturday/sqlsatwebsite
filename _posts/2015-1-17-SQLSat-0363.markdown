## Title: Building Perfect SQL Servers, Every Time
 
**Abstract**:
Some of the biggest challenges in any large SQL environment are maintaining consistent configurations and meeting the pressures from the business for rapid server deployments. Join us in this session to learn best practices for system settings, file system layout, and scheduling maintenance tasks. 

By default, SQL Server does not install with best practices for every environment. In this session, we will discuss the best practices for most SQL Server configurations, and how to automate your SQL Server builds in both physical and virtual worlds. As you may know, completely automating the build process has great benefits, but it also has great trade-offs. We will talk about lessons learned from building a private cloud at a Fortune 100 telecommunications company with thousands of servers. 

You will also learn how use these same methods to ensure your own server build consistency, whether your SQL Servers are in the cloud or on-premises.

## Title: Who Moved My Tuple--Columnstore Indexes in SQL Server 2014.
 
**Abstract**:

Data Warehouse workloads can be very large and taxing on your database server. With the modern demands of real-time analytics against growing volumes of data this challenge continues. When columnstore indexes and batch mode query processing were introduced in SQL Server 2012 were a performance game changer. In the 2012 implementation of columnstore, direct updating and inserting of data was not supported and other restrictions, such as data types limited the use of the feature. SQL 2014 removes those limitations—you can use a columnstore index as a clustered index, and more importantly directly perform DML against the index. Also, more query operators support batch mode, which means more of your queries can see performance benefits. You will understand the changes for 2014—and how having updateable columnstore indexes may cause changes to your process design. You will see the power of columnstore indexes in analytics, their limits, and how to include them into your system design.

## Title: Oracle Tools in a SQL Server World?
 
**Abstract**:
Use a Mac? Need to generate a data model for your database? Have some T-SQL you'd like to get working in an Oracle Database? These are just a few reasons you might find the development and design tools from Oracle Corp useful.

Oracle SQL Developer Data Modeler is a design tool that supports SQL Server. Oracle SQL Developer is a database IDE that allows for JDBC connections to SQL Server. It also has a T-SQL to Oracle SQL  PLSQL translator.

In this session, Oracle SQL Developer  Product Manager Jeff Smith will give an overview of both tools and show a few use cases for the SQL Server professional.

By the way, all of this stuff is free. This may be your only chance to see a session with no sales pitch from your favorite vendor.

## Title: Revenge: The SQL! - Director's Cut
 
**Abstract**:
Pop quiz DBA: Your developers are running rampant in production. Logic, reason, and threats have all failed. You're on the edge. What do you do? WHAT DO YOU DO?

Hint: You attend Revenge: The SQL! 

This session will show you how to "correct" all those bad practices. Everyone logging in as sa? Running huge cursors? Using SELECT * and ad-hoc SQL? Stop them dead, without actually killing them. Ever dropped a table, or database, or WHERE clause? You can prevent that! And if you’re tired of folks ignoring your naming conventions, make them behave with Unicode…and take your revenge!

Revenge: The SQL! is fun and educational and may even have some practical use, but you’ll want to attend simply to indulge your Dark Side. Revenge: The SQL! assumes no liability and is not available in all 50 states. Do not taunt Revenge: The SQL! or Happy Fun Ball.

**Abstract**:
Ever encounter a table consisting only of BIGINT, CHAR(255), and NVARCHAR(MAX) columns? Did your gut tell you that this is bad, but you had difficulty explaining why? Did you know that these data type choices can be a real performance killer? 

Attend this session to learn how database records are stored within SQL Server, and why all data types are not created equal. Armed with that knowledge, we will then explore several performance scenarios that may be impacting your systems right now! 

When you leave, you will be able to explain to your colleagues why data type choices matter, assess your own systems, and implement some best practices to mitigate these performance killers.

## Title: Introduction to Wait Types and Response Time Analysis
 
**Abstract**:
Using Response Time Analysis and Wait Types is a newer method for tuning SQL Server instances. As a result, there is often confusion on exactly what the data means. The issue typically centers around the fact the wait time data is analyzed at the wrong level or the collected wait time data is not detailed enough. This presentation will focus on these problems and review several real-life case studies of using SQL Server Wait Type data coupled with Response time performance analysis to solve the most difficult performance related issues.

## Title: The Top Ten Mistakes that New Leaders Make
 
**Abstract**:
We can easily recognize a great leader when we see one. The great ones make it look easy while the bad ones look inept. Some people believe that leadership is innate, that a chosen few are born to lead while the rest are destine to follow. But that’s not true. Leadership is a skill; it can be nurtured and developed like any other skill. And as with many things, we can learn from others’ mistakes.

In this session I will introduce the data mining capabilities of Excel. We will talk about scenarios for the use of the tools and how to interpret the results. We will cover data preparation with respect to the mining models. We will also discuss the very important issue of "margin of error" and the dangers of misinterpreting and/or misapplication of the tools and results. Attendees can expect to leave with a clear understanding of the available data mining tools along with how and when to use them.

## Title: Getting Started With SQL Server Replication
 
**Abstract**:
In this session we will examine how SQL Server replication works.  A technology that has been around, this tool is not going anywhere anytime soon.  It's an excellent way to keep a subset of data synched with another database without having to synch the entire thing (although you could if you wanted to!).  We will examine terms, internals, and walk through the setup of different replication pieces so you can implement this technology in your environment.

## Title: Introduction to BIML and BIMLScript
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft has provided some great tools for creating and editing SSIS packages.  First Business Intelligence Development Studio (BIDS) then SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT).  However, when creating an SSIS package you frequently repeat the same steps over and over.  BIML is an XML markup language designed for representing the structure of an SSIS package.  BIML Script takes that structure and generates an SSIS package.In this session we will use BIDS Helper to create a simple SSIS package using BIML.  We will handle a couple SSIS scenarios with BIML and BIML Script.

## Title: Continuous Integration with SQL Server Data Tools
 
**Abstract**:
After a long maturation process, SQL Server Data Tools is emerging as a huge step forward in database development.  It won't be long before Visual Studio replaces SSMS as the primary IDE for SQL Server developers.  One of the greatest benefits of making the switch is the continuous integration capabilities that are now streamlined by the tool set.  In this session we will discuss how SSDT works, the goal of continuous integration, and how you can put them together to dramatically improve your productivity as a database developer.
