## Title: Increase your SSIS productivity with Biml
 
**Abstract**:
Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) is an XML language for Microsoft Business Intelligence that can take your Integration Services package development to the next level. Creating template packages added productivity to your Integration Services development effort. If the template design changes after development begins, a fair amount of rework to packages could be needed. See how Biml can help create template packages that can better adapt to changing business needs and allow for more comprehensive design or redesign. 

This session will be a demo based session that will inspire you to make Biml your number one integration services development tool. Learn how to use Biml scripts to create staging tables and integration services packages. Add metadata to your Biml scripts and really watch the possibilities expand.

## Title: Dynamically Increase your Data Awareness
 
**Abstract**:
Data Profiling is a vital step that is often overlooked in the development process. Integration Services (SSIS) built-in support for data profiling is limited and takes manual user intervention. Learn a new approach to automate data profiling and increase your data awareness. 
In this session we will walk through a framework that dynamically develops a group of packages that can profile data based on the existing metadata within your current environment. By dynamically tracking the metadata within your environment, you can easily maintain your data monitoring solution. This will enable a more thorough view of your ETL environment that will allow you to spot issues faster and create a more scaled infrastructure based on your current performance needs.

## Title: Hecka Fun with Hekaton
 
**Abstract**:
There is a lot of buzz behind Microsoft's In-memory OLTP offering code named Hekaton, but does it really deliver on the performance claims? What are the implementation limits that you need to keep in mind and more importantly what are the use cases where it does and does not makes sense. Join Microsoft Certified Master Jason Horner as he skins the In-Memory OLTP Onion.

As a developer or business intelligence professional you need to make sure that your SSIS loading or business automation processes works effectively under any circumstance. In this session we will show how to configure your environment and packages to leverage logging modes and capture exceptions and errors using design patters and best practices.

## Title: Recovery and Backup for Beginners
 
**Abstract**:
We all know that backups are important. But are we building a backup strategy that can recover in a manner that meets business needs? All too often, we plan a backup strategy without a recovery strategy.

In this session, veteran DBA Mike Hillwig will start with understanding the recovery strategy and work toward implementing the right backups to meet that recovery strategy.  He'll also set the record straight around some very common myths around database recovery and backups.

## Title: PowerShell for Data Professionals
 
**Abstract**:
You’ve heard it said, “If you have to do it twice, automate it.” Cut the learning curve and get a real handle on this powerful automation tool. This session walks you through a dozen scripts to simplify and easily automate time-consuming and tedious elements of your day to day job. This isn’t stuff you’ll use SOMEDAY, these are scripts you can use when you get home tonight. Harness the power of Power Shell to easily find Servers short on space. Script out tables and constraints across all of your databases at once. Backup databases and restore them to a different environment. These tricks and many others will allow PowerShell to simplify your job like no other tool.

## Title: Enforce Best Practices with CMS and Policy Based Management
 
**Abstract**:
If you manage a large environment then you know how hard it can be to make sure all your SQL Servers adhere to best practice settings and more importantly is making sure they stay that way.  I'll show you how to check those settings across all your servers with Central Management Server and how it can help you manage a disperse environment.  You will also learn how to leverage the power of Policy Based Management to help you enforce those settings and standards in your enterprise.  Best of all you will see how to get alerts sent to you when one of your standard settings is changed.

## Title: Setting up your BI Infrastructure
 
**Abstract**:
We know BI in bits and pieces. But imagine if you had to setup the BI infrastructure from scratch. 
What do we need to consider, which players do we consider, what are the components, the HA/DR scenario for the same, what technology to use? These are the questions we will attempt to answer along the way.
What are the best practices involved in creating a BI infrastructure. We can discuss whether to outsource this project or rise above our DBA job and do it ourselves.

**Abstract**:
(Spanish) - This session will explain the AlwaysOn Availability Groups feature which is a high-availability and disaster-recovery solution that provides an enterprise-level alternative to database mirroring.

## Title: Transaction Log Internals: Virtual Log Files
 
**Abstract**:
Experienced DBAs know that SQL Server stores data in data files and transaction log files. What is less commonly known is that the transaction log file is broken up into smaller segments known as Virtual Log Files, or VLFs. 

Having too many VLFs will cause performance to suffer. And having too few will cause backup performance to suffer. How do you strike the right balance?

In this more advanced session, veteran DBA Mike Hillwig will show you what VLFs are, how they're created, how to identify them, and how to strike the right balance between too few and too many.
