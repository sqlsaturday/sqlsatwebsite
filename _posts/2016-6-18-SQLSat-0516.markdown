## Title: Revenge: The SQL! - Director's Cut
 
**Abstract**:
Pop quiz DBA: Your developers are running rampant in production. Logic, reason, and threats have all failed. You're on the edge. What do you do? WHAT DO YOU DO?

Hint: You attend Revenge: The SQL! 

This session will show you how to "correct" all those bad practices. Everyone logging in as sa? Running huge cursors? Using SELECT * and ad-hoc SQL? Stop them dead, without actually killing them. Ever dropped a table, or database, or WHERE clause? You can prevent that! And if you’re tired of folks ignoring your naming conventions, make them behave with Unicode…and take your revenge!

Revenge: The SQL! is fun and educational and may even have some practical use, but you’ll want to attend simply to indulge your Dark Side. Revenge: The SQL! assumes no liability and is not available in all 50 states. Do not taunt Revenge: The SQL! or Happy Fun Ball.

## Title: Lock, Block and Two Smoking Barrels
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server is a high performance relational engine and provides a highly scalable database platform but due to its complexity (and bad programming practices) can be prone to serious concurrency problems, unexpected behaviors, lost updates and much more!
In SQL Server 2005, two optimistic concurrency mechanisms were introduced and touted as the solution to all our problems. Now in SQL Server 2012, 2014 and 2016 even more have followed, but many challenges and problems still remain.
Let’s take a long look into the world of SQL Server concurrency and investigate Pessimistic and Optimistic isolation understanding how they work, when you should use them, and more importantly when they can go very wrong. Don't be staring down the wrong end of SQL Server's two Smoking Barrels and join me for this revealing and thought provoking presentation.

## Title: Taking your application to memory
 
**Abstract**:
Based on our work with converting an existing application to memory optimized tables and natively compiled stored procedures this session, will take you through this journey and show you the (large) gaps between what we have in our normal SQL belt and what is possible in Natively compiled stored procedures. I will show how to overcome all the gaps and get all out normal stuff to work in these monster fast procedures – even the things that the documentation says cannot be done.

You will therefore be taken through the concept of in-memory tables and what to be aware of when considering converting your database tables and code to In-Memory tables and through a life migration demo be given all the tips and tricks I picked up while doing so. After attending this session, you will be able to leverage on the new concepts and work your way around its current limitations to gain enormous speed increase and a lock-free environment.

## Title: Biml for Beginners: Speed up your SSIS development
 
**Abstract**:
SSIS is a powerful tool for extracting, transforming and loading data, but creating and maintaining a large number of SSIS packages can be both tedious and time-consuming. Even if you use templates and follow best practices you often have to repeat the same steps over and over and over again. Handling metadata and schema changes is a manual process, and there are no easy ways to implement new requirements in multiple packages at the same time.

It is time to bring the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) software engineering principle to SSIS projects. First learn how to use Biml and BimlScript to generate SSIS packages from database metadata and implement changes in all packages with just a few clicks. Then take the DRY principle one step further and learn how to update all packages in multiple projects by separating and reusing common code. 

Speed up your SSIS development by using Biml and BimlScript, and see how you can complete in a day what once took more than a week!

## Title: Re-architecting your old-school database to maximize Azure cloud options
 
**Abstract**:
The quickest way to migrate your on-premises OLTP database to Azure is to simply "Lift  Shift".
You create a vm in Azure and size it to match your local system and move your database into it.
This might not be the most cost effective way though and also, you still have to do all the
database maintenance yourself.
In this session we will investigate how we could use more of the cloud features like SQL Database, Redis Cache, Search, etc. in order to truly scale
our system. And we'll see if this increases or lowers the total cost of ownership.
This excercise is about an OLTP system but we will also look at how it affects loading our DWH from this new setup.

## Title: Really mobile first in Microsoft BI? - What's up in mobilty @ MS
 
**Abstract**:
DataZEN? Reporting Services? Power BI? Third Party Tools?
If you apply Microsofts strategy Cloud First Mobile First to Microsoft BI you may wonder where you find the right direction on Mobile BI in this strategy. In the last years  the mobile part was somehow in the fog. This session will jump into the jungle of different approaches and will deliver a clear and understandable Matrix, when you should use what and how it may or may not meet your expectations. We will review the different toolsets under Self-Service and Corporate BI Standards and of course  we also check the mobile device shop to see, which offering fits best on the Hardware available.

## Title: R shines! The 4th force is coming to visualize your data
 
**Abstract**:
If you like to visualize data in the Microsoft Data Platform you use the visualization power of Excel, Power BI or Reporting Services. With the integration of R a 4th force is approaching to help you achieving great visualization results in new ways. This session will help you with the basics of the R language, the integration and of course, applying visualization best practices to it. Base on live demos, we show how to start, what R libraries are useful, how to integrate R in your favorite reporting tools like SSRS or Power BI and what you need to apply corporate identity, manage code and a proper development life cycle. When you walk out of the session, you will think the 4th force is with you and gives you additional visualization super power for your job.

## Title: Building Your T-SQL Tool Kit: Window Function Fundamentals
 
**Abstract**:
Have you pulled a script to identify duplicates from a blog post, but couldn’t quite get it to work, because you weren’t sure what that ROW_NUMBER() function was doing. Maybe you heard talk about creating running totals without using sub-queries, but you got frustrated when the groups weren’t totaling correctly. Or maybe, you’ve never even heard of Window Functions. All are good reasons to attend this all-demo session which demystifies this versatile T-SQL tool. First, we’ll break apart the OVER clause, the key to understanding how window functions work. Then we’ll expand on each group of functions that can use the OVER clause: ranking, aggregate, and analytic functions. Finally, we’ll look at real scenarios where this tool works and talk about performance considerations. When you leave, you’ll have the fundamentals you need to fully develop your mastery of Window Functions.

## Title: Calling Captain Ahab, from Unknown Knowns to Known
 
**Abstract**:
Persistence of databases and crash recovery is a fundamental problem in systems research, particularly in database management systems, key-value stores, and file systems.
Crash recovery is hard to get right; as evidence ten-year gap between the release of commercial database products, System R and DB2 and the development of a working crash recovery algorithm. Even after it was invented, another five years passed before the algorithm was proven correct. 
Modern day Database owners and administrators have to navigate trough a horde of backup methodologies and false promises in order to preserve data. In this lecture we will cover many of the modern day database data protection technologies, and there pros and cons.

## Title: Simplifying SQL Server Migrations using PowerShell
 
**Abstract**:
What if migrating SQL Server instances was as simple as executing a single command? 

In this presentation, I'll cover the reasons companies migrate, the ways SQL migrations are usually performed, and the considerations that must be made when performing a migration.

Then I'll show you how to use the PowerShell dbatools module to simplify your SQL Server migrations. dbatools makes migrating databases, logins, linked servers, credentials, jobs, database mail, and other essential SQL components extremely easy.

## Title: Go, go, QueryStore!
 
**Abstract**:
One of the hardest things to do in SQL is to identify the cause of a sudden degradation in performance. The DMVs don’t persist information over a restart of the instance and, unless there was already some query benchmarking (and there almost never is), answering the question of how the queries behaved last week needs a time machine. Up until now, that is. The addition of the QueryStore to SQL Server 2016 makes identifying and resolving performance regressions a breeze.

In this session we’ll take a look at what the QueryStore is and how it works, before diving into a scenario where overall performance suddenly degraded, and we’ll see why QueryStore is the best new feature in SQL Server 2016, bar none.

## Title: How Good Is Your Indexing Strategy?
 
**Abstract**:
Like Frankenstein's Monster (or our teenagers) things get released into the wild and behave differently than planned - database usage patterns are no different.  Join Tim as he reviews what to look for when tweaking your index strategy: poor clustering key decisions, underutilized indexes, covering indexes gone wrong, overlooked heaps and fill factor failures are just a few of the blunders to be identified.  

A working knowledge of Dynamic Management Objects, indexing internals, and eagerness to experiment with metadata is a prerequisite!

## Title: Digging Into the .Net SqlClient
 
**Abstract**:
The prevailing opinion is that the optimizations for SQL Server are usually only done on the server itself. But is there anything we can do on the client to gain more speed? In this session aimed at .Net and SQL developers, we'll dive into the workings of the .Net SqlClient and give you insight into way more than just SqlCommand.ExecuteReader() and SqlCommand.ExecuteNonQuery().
