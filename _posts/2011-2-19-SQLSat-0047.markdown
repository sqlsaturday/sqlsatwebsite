## Title: DBA as Protector of the Data: Notes from the Field
 
**Abstract**:
The DBA can be the last line of defense guarding the integrity of their company’s data. Taking this responsibility seriously will make you more successful in your job. This session will discuss how the DBA can proactively ensure the data in their transactional system is clean and correct. The presenter will take a comprehensive view of this crucial aspect of the DBA’s job, drawing on many real-life examples. The topics covered will include table design, transactions, change management, and coding standards. She will explain how these distinct topics are actually part of an integrated approach to data protection. The presenter will also describe how pessimism and vigilance can be valuable traits for a DBA.

## Title: (SSIS, TSQL and MDS) - Record Linkage(Fuzzy Matchi
 
**Abstract**:
We will implement several code samples based on a series of articles amd posts identifying similar records between two different sources or grouping of records from a single source, based on existing column string of values. We will define an approach, review actual implementations with various SQL tools(TSQL, VB,SSIS and MDS). There are many facets to review. I would like to start by drawing concepts from several articles from experienced practitioners, either from academia or the commercial market. They will be footnoted at the end of the session. Although we are discussing matching, we need to address several steps prior to getting to the actual use of matching algorithms

## Title: Where Are My Reports? Managing Reporting Services
 
**Abstract**:
Reporting Services has quickly become and enterprise class report delivery system. As such, user adoption can grow quite rapidly and before you know it higher usage can bring the Report Server to its knees. This is why monitoring and maintaining reporting services from the beginning is important part of any deployment. 

In this session we will cover common scenarios for monitoring reporting services performance, tracking down performance issues and troubleshooting errors. We will also review solutions to improve performance in the report execution and engine configuration. Finally, we will discuss techniques to scale up and scale out to distribute load and isolate various forms of activity.

## Title: Creating a Metadata Mart w/ SSIS - Data Governance
 
**Abstract**:
Recently I have had a client that required migrating and re hosting a data warehouse from the Oracle environment to the Netezza Appliance. The application had hundreds of tables and almost 2900 Source to Target Mappings. This would have taken 1000's of hours of manual coding. For this client we implemented a reusable data driven architecture , via SSIS, that relys on a metadata mart. The end result a greatly reduced TCO(developemnt effort) for generating the code required vs manual cosing. In addition the process leaves behind a metadata mart to report on for auditing and other Data Governance efforts. We generated over 100,000 lines of code and over 3000 load scripts

## Title: Tuna Helper - Proven Process for Tuning SQL
 
**Abstract**:
Many DBAs and developers are faced with tuning poorly performing SQL statements. There is no way to learn everything you need to know about SQL tuning in an hour, but you can learn a process to employ when badly written SQLs are ruining database performance. However, many tuning projects fail because the process being used is inefficient. This presentation will walk through a process Confio Software uses with great success and will include topics such as: SQL diagramming, wait type data, column selectivity, and several more that will help you succeed on future tuning projects.

I am a SQL Server and Oracle DBA. I focus mostly on SQL Server. I use Powershell every day and I make my life as a DBA much easier by scripting most tasks in Powershell. I enjoy helping others with Powershell and SQL Server, even though I claim to be an expert in neither. I enjoy technology and spending time with my wife and new child.
