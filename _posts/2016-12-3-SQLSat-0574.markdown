## Title: The Art of War with Bad Code
 
**Abstract**:
Let’s face it, many of us are at war with poorly written or poorly tuned queries and processes. There is usually just one of you who has been tasked with managing one or more SQL Server instances while there are hundreds or even thousands of users of which a certain percentage will inevitably write poor code. So you must battle it out to identify the culprits before they wreak too much havoc on your systems. We will see several fairly straightforward techniques to positively identify the culprits and allow you to prioritize your efforts in tuning them to give you the biggest ROI for your time. TSQL and Extended Events code examples will be provided that you can use immediately in your environment to become more productive.

## Title: Creating Dynamic Packages
 
**Abstract**:
In a perfect world an ETL solution would only have to import data from a single file that always had the same name deliver it to a single already existing table.  Unfortunately this case is the exception rather than the rule.  How can you use SSIS to: 
1.    Iterate through all files in a folder and import their content into SQL
2.    Dynamically create and name table based on a data source 
3.    Dynamically create a T-SQL statement at runtime based on run time conditions
This session focuses on how to create SSIS packages that can change to meet runtime events dynamically based on the environment.
Each attendee will leave with the knowledge and toolset necessary to:
1.      Use expressions within SSIS packages
2.      Use variables to dynamically create SQL statements
3.      Configure custom dynamic logging
4.      Use package configurations and parameters and environments to make packages more portable at execution
5. 	Replace dynamic SQL using expressions in SSIS

## Title: The Many Paths of Consulting
 
**Abstract**:
People often dream of becoming a consultant, but what does that actually mean? Is consulting really the right path for you? Many choices are available when deciding to become a consultant, but these options can be overlooked. Contracting, consulting for an established team, going out on your own, or looking to build a larger business are all great options, depending on your vision and future goals.

This session will help you ask the right questions to better chose and prepare for your path. We then explore the various realities and strategies of each path. Real-life experiences will be shared to help you make the most informed decision on which path is best for you, and how to accelerate your career as a consultant.

## Title: Top 10 Dos and Don’ts for Clustered SQL Server Implementations
 
**Abstract**:
Whether you are a new DBA or a seasoned veteran, clustered implementations of SQL Server can still vex many in one way or another. Physical, virtual, and cloud-based architectures all have different subtle complexities when it comes to deploying either clustered instances of SQL Server (FCIs) or availability groups (AGs) regardless if you are using an older version or SQL Server 2016. Storage, networking, Active Directory, quorum, the overall underlying Windows Server failover cluster, and more are topics that come up quite often. This session will cut to the chase and concentrate nearly 20 years of experience down into the most relevant aspects of planning, deployment, and administration of clustered implementations that every DBA should know. The ten dos and don’ts presented could not only mean the difference between success and failure, but whether your systems are up or down.

## Title: Imposter Syndrome: Are You Faking It  Will they Find Out?
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever thought to yourself  “All these people think I’m smarter than I really am" or "I really don’t know what I’m doing, they're going to figure out I'm a fraud!”  If yes, then you suffer from the Impostor Syndrome. And despite all the accomplishments, awards and accolades, you still doubt yourself. It’s rampant in the modern day tech workplace, and the fear will make you shrink back from opportunities. You dismiss praise. You overcompensate by working harder, being charming and demanding perfection from yourself. What would happen if you were released from this bondage, and kicked your impostor to the curb? In this session, learn 3 powerful techniques that can help to improve your confidence and silent that annoying voice in your head!

## Title: Location Location Location Preparing and Presenting Geographic Data 
 
**Abstract**:
This session will begin with the tasks necessary to model a dimensional data structure to maintain and present geographic data.  We will discuss various requirements that can affect a data model such as granularity, surrogate keys, slowly changing dimensions.  Real life examples and solutions will provided to give better context to each step in the process.
After the data structure has been created we will focus on how to best “clean” and validate the geographic data.  We will focus on using SSIS to obtain latitude and longitude and then how this can be converted SQL Server spatial types.
Finally we will cover presenting this data using SSRS and Power Map and how to create dynamic and aesthetically pleasing graphical reports.  This portion of the session concentrates on presenting reports using the geographic data type that answer specific questions such as:
Events that occurred at a specific address, zip code, and even block range and events within a mile radius.

## Title: A Discussion on Azure SQL Database Security Features for the Cloud Objectionist
 
**Abstract**:
This session is for the those who have security objections related to moving to the cloud or are interested in the security features of the of the Azure SQL Database, a relational database Platform as a Service offering in Microsoft Azure.  There certainly are Azure SQL Database features which have parity with SQL Server engine features (Always Encrypted, TDE, RLS, etc.).  But this session will take a look at security features focused on the Azure SQL Database; server firewall settings, Auditing  Threat detection,  Alert Rules, Role-based Access Control and configuring Azure AD Authentication.  If time permits, we will step through Dynamic Data Making via the Azure portal.  Hopefully the main take away will be a warm and fuzzy (and more secure) feeling about planning for cloud workloads.

## Title: Getting to 99.99% Uptime Delivering Operational Excellence
 
**Abstract**:
How does one take advice from the top leadership experts and translate into action?  As one's responsibilities grow many more factors come into play to achieving both the realities and perception of high availability.  The building of professional relationships, managing expectations, helping with setting standards and procedures are all critical components to success.   While some will argue this is out of my scope of responsibilities why should I care about the building of professional relationships, managing expectations, helping with setting standards and procedures?  The answer is simple because the perception is that no matter where the process breaks down it’s always a database problem.  Managing customer expectations what do you really mean by 99.99% up time, translating business requirements to operational realities, commonly overlooked items that impact your 4 nines  Avoiding human errors the realities and perception of high availability.

## Title: Rewriting Your Checklist for SQL 2016
 
**Abstract**:
How big should the page file be for Windows Server 2016? How many data files should SQL Server 2016's TempDB contain? What trace flags should we use by default now?
 
These are questions you addressed long ago in your setup checklist. You've spent a lot of time with that checklist, and you're sure it's perfect. Or is it? When was the last time you visited that checklist?  Does it make sense for SQL 2014? What about SQL 2016? Change is hard, and DBAs need to constantly challenge yesterday's best practices to ensure they meet today's business needs.
 
Join veteran DBA Mike Hillwig and his list of server administration best practices that need to be revisited for modern versions of SQL Server, especially SQL 2016.

## Title: Unit-Testing in SQL Server - An Introduction
 
**Abstract**:
It’s bad enough to spend hours finding and fixing database defects, explaining to the rest of the team what went wrong and trying to clean up the mess. It’s even worse when a defect causes the end-user to make a bad decision. Database defects are far too costly and most testing practices do not adequately detect or prevent them.

In this session you’ll learn techniques to write SQL code that is resilient to defects and is easier to change and maintain. We will cover writing simple unit tests and look into more advanced topics such as faking tables and spying procedures. We will also look at how unit testing improves code quality and maintainability.

You will leave this session ready to write unit tests for your own environment to get started on the way to a defect-free and maintainable SQL Server code base.

## Title: Why should I care about ... the plan cache?
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this installment of Rick's "Why should I care" series, he lays out a case for why working knowledge of the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments. A review of relevant views and functions is included for the (newly?) motivated audience.

Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why their DBAs drink in the morning (allegedly). This is not a deep dive into the cache, it really is primarily a session exploring _why_ these DMOs are worth slogging through.

## Title: Blue Collar SQL Tricks - Make Standard Edition Work for you.
 
**Abstract**:
You want Enterprise Edition of SQL Server? Not gonna happen!  When we are limited by having just the Standard version we have to dig into our “Blue Collar” roots, we need to become more creative and squeeze every penny it has to offer out of it.

In this session, we will review some of the limitations that Standard has.  Then review items such as basic normalization and  High Availability options available to Standard.   You will also learn Blue Collar techniques to implement partitioning using techniques like as indexed views and partitioned views.

Let’s dig in and learn to make use of all we have until we beg our bosses enough to get Enterprise Edition!

## Title: SQL Server Databaseology: A Deep Dive Into Database Internals
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever taken apart a toaster or an alarm clock just to see how it worked? Ever wondered how that database actually functions at the record level, behind the scenes? SQL Server Databaseology is the study of SQL Server databases and their structures down to the very core of the records themselves. In this session, we will explore some of the deep inner workings of a SQL Server database at the record and page level.  You will walk away with a better understanding of how SQL Server stores data and that knowledge will allow you to build better, faster databases.

## Title: Don't Let History Be a Mystery! Temporal Data in SQL Server 2016
 
**Abstract**:
It's been said that the only constant is change, and no truism better defines the average database workload. With data constantly shifting in form and focus, DBAs and developers find themselves fielding myriad questions about whens and whys: When did this fact get updated? Why is data quality lower than it was last week? And where did my sales figures go?!? Solutions such as Change Tracking, Change Data Capture, and hand-rolled triggers can each be leveraged to help in this scenario, but with various ugly tradeoffs. SQL Server 2016 introduces Temporal Tables, a new technology that finally gets us what we've needed all along. In this session you'll learn how to enable seamless and automatic history collection, take control of a great query experience, and build on a solid platform to help your users understand data history. By taking advantage of this fantastic feature, you'll approach your next project ready to answer all of the questions that constant change brings to the table.

## Title: Query Store – What is it all about?
 
**Abstract**:
SQL 2016 brings us many new features but one of the most anticipated is surely the Query Store. The Query Store now allows us to track query plans as they change over time giving us a whole slew of new possibilities when it comes to tuning our queries. Even just the ability to compare a previous plan to a new plan is a huge step towards understanding what may be happening in our instance. We can even tell the optimizer which plan we want it to use. These were all either extremely difficult to do before and in some cases impossible to do. This session will give you the insight to get started using this new and wonderful feature set.

## Title: Why Should I Care About ... Partitioned Views?
 
**Abstract**:
Partitioned tables are awesome and partitioned views are dead, right? Well, sure partitioned views are not sexy but there are still plenty of applications where they are critical. And not necessarily just for standard edition. If your data is time stamped, do you see different queries run against older data than new data? Do you with you could segment your data across multiple columns? Do you have data you need to partition horizontally? It's possible partitioned views may still be for you. Come hear why this is still an important topic long after cargo pants and trucker hats went away.

## Title: Demystifying Data Compression
 
**Abstract**:
High-end storage is expensive, and SQL Server data compression can make your database smaller. So compress all the tables! 

No--unfortunately, it's not that easy. We'll talk about how data compression actually works, and the differences between ROW and PAGE compression. As part of this, we'll look at the costs and benefits associated with each type of compression. By the end of this session, you'll have a better idea of how the different compression algorithms work, when compression is the right solution, as well as what type of compression to use.

## Title: Troubleshooting Blocking for Beginners
 
**Abstract**:
Your SQL Server is slow, and you suspect blocking. You need to set up simple, lightweight monitoring using free tools to document who’s holding locks, who’s stuck waiting, and which queries are causing deadlocks. In this session we will work through three common scenarios where blocking problems steal your performance -- and sometimes even kill your queries! You'll learn how to cut through the confusion with free scripts that reveal why queries are slowing down your SQL Server.

## Title: WIT: Identifying, Understanding and Combating Gender Bias
 
**Abstract**:
Gender Bias is something we're all guilty of. It's typically unconscious and often stems from long held misperceptions about women and job responsibilities. We'll learn about the origins of some of these biases and how to identify gender bias when we see it. We'll discuss some strategies for how both men and women can combat this at work and in our every day lives. This session is about developing positive solutions to a problem that often goes undiscussed.

## Title: Understanding SQL Server 2016 Always Encrypted
 
**Abstract**:
Always Encrypted is a highly-touted new feature of SQL Server 2016 that promises to make encryption simple to use and transparent to applications while still protecting the data both at rest and in motion, even from high-privilege users such as developers and DBAs.  Does that sound too good to be true?  It isn’t - Always Encrypted is an incredible feature - but like any new technology, it does have some limitations.  In this session, you’ll see how to configure Always Encrypted, and we’ll talk about when you should and shouldn’t use it in your environment.

## Title: CONVERT_IMPLICIT is a hidden danger
 
**Abstract**:
Abstract: The CONVERT_IMPLICIT operator is part of an execution plan. When an execution plan has a CONVERT_IMPLICIT operator, this is a signal that “your statement has a problem”. This presentation will show you how to detect the Execution Plans with CONVERT_IMPLICIT operator; how to find the statement that causes conversion, and what DMVs can help to solve the problem. It will also show you the solution to collect the Execution Plans with CONVERT_IMPLICIT operator across the servers.
