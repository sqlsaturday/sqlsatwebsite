## Title: Comparing Predictive Models from R, Python, SSAS, and Azure ML
 
**Abstract**:
There is a lot of overlapping in Microsoft BI suite. For advanced analytics, like data mining, you can use SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS), or R, or Python, or Azure ML. The question arises which tool to use. The answer is simple, through another question. Why not all of them? 
In data mining, you typically create multiple predictive models for the same task, and then evaluate them to select the best one. So why wouldn’t you even use different tools for different models? You will learn how to evaluate the predictive models. Then you will see how to bring all of the mining models together and compare them no matter of the source they come from. You will see how you can use SQL Server Integration Services, Excel, and other tools for this task.

## Title: Clever data: Building a chatbot from your database
 
**Abstract**:
The development of Artificial Intelligence is increasingly present in our lives and as time goes by, its presence will grow thanks to the momentum that enterprises are currently providing. 

One of the most engaging AI applications are chatbots, which interact with real-time users in order to assist them to perform a task -such as booking a hotel, answering a question or looking for specific information on the Internet- while simulating that a real human is behind the scene.

Data is knowledge, and the data that has been stored in your Azure SQL database can be used as an input for a bot which assists a company's customers in order to process the information for them and return expected results.

This session will be focused on explaining the actors involved when building a bot capable of obtaining data from your storage, including Azure SQL Database, Microsoft Bot Framework and LUIS (Language Understanding Intelligent Services). A mobile app built with Xamarin will be used as demo.

## Title: Power BI as a universal analytic tool
 
**Abstract**:
In Power BI, you can also do other kinds of analyses than just business analytics. In this lecture you’ll see, how you can use Power BI together with cloud services for quick check of facts from freely available data sources, even if they aren’t published in a particularly suitable format. You will also see, how you can quickly analyze unstructured text (e.g. communication with customers). At the end we will take a look at PowerApps, using which you can not only quickly create a new business app in your web browser, but also integrate it in your Power BI reports, so that you can quickly react to results and take action from a single environment. Because Power BI is capable of doing much more than “just” business analyses.

## Title: Practical Real-World Performance Tuning for Accidental DBAs
 
**Abstract**:
In most of the organizations, accidental DBAs are the individuals who are often responsible for the SQL Server Performance. In the real world when we face any performance problems, we do not have the luxury to open PowerPoint and study theory. What helps us during the time of crisis are handy scripts which help us fix our performance problems.
In this quick paced, demonstration-oriented learning session, we will see how we can immediately help our application with performance if we just know what exactly to do.
We will cover the following topics during our session 
a) Learn and Implement best deployment and configurations practices
b) Indexing (and statistics) best practices deployments
c) Understanding cardinality and compatibility levels and their impact
d) Enabling SQL Server 2019 (on-premises and cloud) new features
e) Secret Performance Tuning Scripts

## Title: Power BI (Premium) Implementation at a Financial Institute
 
**Abstract**:
Back to September 2016: Power BI is new, shiny and hot. It is the tool of the moment, so people cannot wait to get their hands on it.
Fast forward 6 months, there is more traction within the business, training is given and workshops are held. The adoption of Power BI is growing. Some departments already use Power BI very extensively and incorporate it in their day-to-day processes. Due to this quick success there is uncertainty regarding the right support team for incidents and problems.
Because an app workspace creates an Office 365 group with a lot of artifacts behind the scenes, the creation workflow is controlled by IT. Unfortunately this inhibits the end users.
We require more governance, not to further bother the users, but it is essential to stay in control. Responsibilities need to be better aligned between IT and the business.
Throughout this session we take you along on our Power BI journey, with tips, tricks, do's and don'ts during the implementation of Power BI (Premium).

## Title: Designing your tabular/PowerBI model for performance and scalability
 
**Abstract**:
You developed a PowerBI or an Analysis Services Tabular model and you run it on a server with plenty of cores and memory. But your queries does not scale or your users are not happy with the performance! So what can you do? You can fine tune the settings of your AS Tabular (usually does not bring a large benefit), you can scale up (which is costly) or you can apply the techniques I am going to show you in this session. Techniques, that range from optimizing the storage of your model, to how to effectively implement DAX patterns for maximum performance. And all of that, complemented with digging into engine execution plans, DMVs, tracing activity and tabular engine internals.

## Title: Performance Troubleshooting Using DMVs
 
**Abstract**:
Performance troubleshooting is a complex subject with many factors under consideration when you find poorly performing SQL statements, using proven methodologies, and evaluating performance data available in the Dynamic Management Views and Functions. In this session, we’ll go over a foundation of how and which DMVs to use to identify those problematic statements for versions of SQL Server from 2005 – 2017 and will also include improvements for the 2019 release.

We’ll be demonstrating using practical examples, including code that can be taken away and used on attendees’ own SQL Servers. We’ll also discuss how to identify common causes of performance issues, and learn how to quickly review and understand the wealth of performance data available.

## Title: Common Data Science Mistakes
 
**Abstract**:
In the middle of deploying the model, team of data scientists realize that the predictions are "somewhat-off". Troubleshooting on the horizon and what to do. Session will guide you through most common mistakes data scientists and statisticians are making when preparing and engineering the data using T-SQL or any other database system. Further more, we will explore common statistical and data science mistakes when modeling data, extracting know-how from the data, finding the hidden patterns and running different test against the structural models using mainly R, Python, or Spark. What not-to-do will be replaced with what to-do explanations using sample datasets and sample codes. Some statistical knowledge or background is a plus!

## Title: Intelligent Query Processing in SQL Server 2019
 
**Abstract**:
Performance is one of the most important parts of a healthy database system, but sometimes a query performance may suffer, for a variety of reasons. In one case we may find a reason and fix it easily, while in the other case, it is much harder.

SQL Server 2017 introduced a new approach for solving performance problems called Adaptive Query Processing. SQL Server 2019 evolves those mechanisms and the entire feature family now is named – Intelligent Query Processing.

The Intelligent query processing in SQL Server 2019 includes the following:
- Adaptive Query Processing enhancements
- Table Variable Deferred Compilation
- Approximate Query Processing
- Scalar UDF Inlining

In this session we will see how do these features work and in what cases they might be helpful.

## Title: Data scientists have left ... How will I deploy their work?
 
**Abstract**:
Description
That's it, data scientists have left the house! Behind them, some scripts written in Python or R, thousands of CSV files, three sheets and two whiteboards of mathematical equations, many PowerPoint presentations and a clear instruction from the CEO: go to production ASAP! Unfortunately, no trace of a deployment procedure. Hopefully, this session, will explain how to industrialize data scientists' scripts. How to import and refactor code written in Jupyter Notebooks within VS Code, How to put in place the best practices of DevOps and apply them to Machine Learning with Azure Pipelines and some other tips and tricks for a successful go-live.
