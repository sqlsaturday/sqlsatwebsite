## Title: Data Modeling for the Modern Data Warehouse
 
**Abstract**:
A theoretical discussion on two methods that professional data modelers use to model data (ERD and star schema). 

We discuss why we need to model data, benefits / value of modeling data, and why we select one modeling technique over the other. Once we understand why and when we use these different modeling techniques, we will focus in on dimensional modeling that is used when developing data warehouses, SSAS cubes and Power BI. 

Sample diagrams will be used to explain these different modeling techniques and try to bring a more tangible aspect to the theoretical aspects of the discussion.

## Title: Proper DataType Usage=Guaranteed Better Performance and Accuracy
 
**Abstract**:
It’s an all too common occurrence to have table columns or variables that have been assigned less than ideal data types. 

In this demo-heavy presentation I will show you the importance of choosing the proper data type; show you some guidelines in determining what an appropriate data type would be; and once chosen, give you some tools for its usage and management. I will demonstrate several performance and accuracy issues, along with their possible solutions, caused by either the assignment of inappropriate data types or improper usage of them. In addition I will cover several data type related functions, and point out caveats in their usage. I expect even advanced T-SQL developers and DBAs to walk away with a useful nugget or two.

## Title: Lockless in Seattle: Using In-Memory OLTP Transaction Processing
 
**Abstract**:
Locks and latches have long been the mechanism used to implement SQL Server concurrency control, but with the introduction of In-Memory OLTP the paradigm has shifted. Are we really looking at the Brave New World of Transaction Processing or a dystopian nightmare?

In this session, we will understand how In-Memory OLTP architecture is implemented and how its mechanics function. We will learn what transactional bad dependencies and other considerations are introduced by its use and what capabilities are provided by SQL Server 2016.

## Title: SQL Server on Linux, a new frontier
 
**Abstract**:
At one time, Microsoft SQL Server was only available on the Windows platform.  This expanded to the Azure cloud environment, though still on the Windows platform.  One stronghold of the other RDB vendors remained and it has a significant installed base, Linux.  Well, not just Linux, but "Open Source" systems and those derived from the open source operating systems, OS X included.  
With the release of Microsoft SQL Server for Linux, this last major hurdle in the enterprise is starting to fall.  There is much more product development work needed to catch its older brother, but Microsoft SQL Server for Linux has become interesting and viable for the enterprise and hobbyist.  Join me as we take a look at what is currently available in Microsoft SQL Server for Linux.

## Title: The Power of Data:  The Complete Beginners Data Warehouse Kit
 
**Abstract**:
For many of us data is scattered in many different systems.  We almost all have data that someone wants to compare or track but can't without a lot of manual manipulation.  So, how do you tie disparate systems together? With a Data Warehouse! In this presentation you will get the skills you need to start building your own. We will discuss the basics of what a Data Warehouse is, the tools needed to create, deploy and manage the Data Warehouse process, and the benefits of using the data you collect to manage operational processes and create data visualizations. After attending this session you will be able to return to your job and amaze people with your ability to show them the power of the data!

## Title: PowerBI, from a DBA
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft’s PowerBI is the new hotness. In this session, you will get your hands dirty and dive into PowerBI and create an actual report, with actual data. You will get to learn from examples from what a DBA has done to implement PowerBI in his shop and make his data accessible.

As a DBA, we often need to collect and display data in a friendly and interactive fashion. We will play with some PowerShell to collect data from several systems, store this data in an Azure DB in the Cloud, then point PowerBI at this data to display and interact with said data. You will learn a little about PowerShell, Azure SQL DB, PowerBI, and how to make these work for you.

## Title: Querying Semistructured Data in Azure Data Lake with USQL
 
**Abstract**:
Data is exploding across enterprises.  Much of it is semi-structured junk.  Or is it junk?  What are you going to do with it until you can find out?  Microsoft’s Azure Data Lake is a cloud storage and analytical service for parking a variety of data.  When you are ready, you can query that semi-structured data using an ANSI SQL language called U-SQL.  In this session I will demonstrate the similarities and differences between U-SQL and T-SQL.  I will demonstrate how easy it is to build a query against 21 GB of CSV files. Such queries can help you determine whether you have a gold mine in your data or a bunch of garbage before investing in a full data warehouse build.

## Title: Implementing Python in SQL Server 2017
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2016 added R to the analytical toolset and SQL Server 2017 has added Python.  When looking at various lists of the most popular programming languages, Python always has one of the top positions.  This session provides an introduction to Python, including why it is a good choice for analyzing data.  
If you have not had a chance to review SQL Server 2017 yet, please attend to see some of the new changes coming later this year.  One of the features covers will show what is needed to incorporate Python into SQL Server and how Python can be incorporated in stored procedures to provide the ability to analyze data using arguably the most popular programming language to review data.

## Title: Solving Common DBA Problems With R
 
**Abstract**:
External script languages were introduced to SQL Server in 2016, starting with R and continuing with Python in SQL 2017.  To familiarize myself, I attended various community sessions, but each one was about statistics, anomaly detection, or forecasting.  That's all interesting, but it’s not my thing, so we won't be talking about any of that!  This is a demo rich session about things you didn't know you could do from SQL Server with the help of R, such as parse JSON or convert to CSV, integrate Azure Key Vault for securely storing passwords, get documents from Azure Cosmos DB and add them to your data warehouse, archive tables across platforms, quick and simple ETL, and finding out easily which column of data is causing that "String or Binary data will be truncated" error.  Come join me for some eye opening demos about the many practical uses of R for non-statisticians!

## Title: Data Wrangling for Reporting  Analytics using Power BI
 
**Abstract**:
In today’s world reporting and analytics are no longer focused exclusively on internal data from transactional systems and the data warehouse. 
Mashups using data from partners, commercial and public sources are fast becoming the new normal.
Do you have a csv file too big to open, is a non-windows format or generates errors on import or opening?
Need to determine the quality of a file downloaded from the internet or supplied by another party?
In this presentation we will review tools to examine/repair schema issues and explore Power BI Desktop features that provide insights into your datasets along with the M language for building mashups and data models.

## Title: Challenges and Opportunities in Creating Accessible Power BI Reports
 
**Abstract**:
Accessibility is catering for your whole audience, including those with disabilities. According to the US Census Bureau, 19 percent of the of the population had a disability in 2010. Do you know if your reports are designed in an inclusive way such that everyone can use them? This can be especially important if you are making reports for government entities, educational institutions, or the general public. In this session, we'll discuss accessibility standards and regulations of which you may want to be aware, how users with disabilities can consume Power BI reports, and guidance and pitfalls when designing inclusive reports.

## Title: Very Large Databases in your future
 
**Abstract**:
Your databases may not be terabyte-sized yet, but they're probably growing every day. We'll look at lessons learned 
from working with multi-terabyte, very large databases (VLDBs) in the real world. Topics include storage layout 
decisions, unique tuning challenges, HA/DR implications, and database restores, along with shoehorning backups, re-
indexing and DBCC checks into itty-bitty maintenance windows. As a bonus, many of the techniques also apply to smaller databases and consolidated servers that run hundreds of databases.

## Title: Query Optimization Statistics : Driving Force Behind Performance
 
**Abstract**:
When the SQL Server optimizer evaluates a query to determine how best to execute it, the statistics are quite possibly the most important tool at its disposal. But SQL Server statistics objects aren’t perfect because they only contain estimated summary information. In this session, we’ll start with an overview of what the statistics objects are, how the optimizer uses them, and some general guidelines for their maintenance. Then we’ll look at some of the issues, how to find them, and how to solve them, that can arise due to their imperfection: ascending keys (the most prevalent statistics based performance killer?), correlated predicates, skewed distribution, or downright bad summary information. There’ll be many examples, and even a stored procedure to help you find ascending keys. By applying the techniques we’ll discuss, you WILL see improved query performance.

## Title: Open Source vs SQL Database Maintenance Plans
 
**Abstract**:
The Database Maintenance plans used to be a one size fits all tool that did a lot of unnecessary work, especially, when it came to indexing. So I have been recommending that clients use other tools such as Ola Hallengren’s award winning free SQL Server Maintenance Solution. So let’s have a showdown at high noon in the Arizona desert and see if Database Maintenance Plans in SQL 2016 and 2017 are now good enough or if we still need to turn to other solutions like Ola’s.
