## Title: XML Without Xanax: How to Handle XML in SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Do you cringe whenever you have to look at an XML document? Does the very thought of XML data living in your database make you scream? Do you have a panic attack any time you have to parse XML? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then this session is for you!

We'll start with reasons why having XML in SQL Server might be a good thing, then we'll face our fears and turn tabular data into XML, and finally we'll confront the true source of our anxiety by parsing XML back into tabular data using xQuery.

If you survive this session, you'll have faced your fears about XML in SQL Server, you'll have a solid understanding of creating XML from tabular data, and you'll know how to use xQuery to parse XML.

## Title: Statistics and Query Optimization
 
**Abstract**:
There are any number of tricks and traps around getting the query optimizer to provide you with an optimal execution plan that gets you your data quickly and efficiently. But, at the end of the day, the principal driving factor of the optimizer, and therefore of your queries, are the statistics that define your data. This session teaches you how those statistics are put together and maintained by SQL Server. Different types of maintenance results in different levels of accuracy within statistics so we detail what the structures and information looks like after this maintenance. Your understanding of how the optimizer works with statistics will better enable you to understand why you’re getting the performance and types of execution plans that you are getting. Understanding enables you to write better t-sql statements and deal with performance problems such as bad parameter sniffing.

## Title: Making the Leap from Profiler to Extended Events
 
**Abstract**:
If you’re like me, you’ve been using SQL Trace and Profiler since you started using SQL Server.  They’re like old friends, tried and true.  You know how they work, you know what you can capture, you know how to find the data you need.  But now you’ve been told that your good friends have been deprecated in SQL Server 2012, and you need to become best friends with Extended Events.  What is THAT all about?  It’s ok.  Really.  In this session we’ll look at Profiler and Extended Events side by side to see how easy it is to transition to Extended Events.  We’ll step through real world examples using Extended Events to do what you’re used to doing with Trace, and even more.  You can find the time learn Extended Events…today.

## Title: Hierarchies... on Steroids the No RBAR Way
 
**Abstract**:
Hierarchical data sets are everywhere. If you haven't worked with one yet, you will. If you're already working with them, you know they can be horribly complex, slow performing, difficult to maintain resource hogs that can really take the steam out of any GUI or batch process. This simple but code intensive "black arts" session shows you how to quickly and easily get around all of that using all 3 common hierarchical structures and includes a very high performance method (100,000 nodes in  less than 4 seconds and 1 Million nodes in less than a minute) for converting Adjacency Lists to Nested Sets that even a beginner can understand.  As a finale`, we'll cover a new "pre-aggregated" Hierarchical table structure that answers most of the questions you'd ask of a Hierarchy. You just have to know that a Tally Table is involved somewhere in this. ;-)

## Title: Manageable SSAS Deployment Strategies
 
**Abstract**:
When it comes to making changes to your production Analysis Services databases, do you simply open the SSAS DB in SQL Server Data Tools (or BIDS) and click through creating the changes? Does this method lead to problems keeping everything in sync and the right changes deployed to the right environment at the right time? Have you, the BI developer, had to fight to get Production access to do your own deployments?

If you've answered "yes" to any of these questions, and are in search of a better way, I have the solution! In this demo-heavy session, will look at five steps to more robust, controllable, and flexible Tabular and Multidimensional SSAS deployments.

## Title: Discover, Document,  Diagnose Your Servers on Your Coffee Break
 
**Abstract**:
Documentation is the bane of every DBA's existence. We all know we should do it but it's time consuming; by the time you're finally done it's probably out of date. Throw in the new servers you just found out about last week and keeping documentation up to date can turn into a full time job. And with everything we have to do in our day, who has time for that?

You need a way to work smarter, not harder, and automate your documentation. It can be done, and in this session you'll learn how to discover all the SQL Servers on your network, document their configuration from top to bottom (including OS details), and diagnose common problems before they turn into big headaches - all while you're on a coffee break. You'll look like a rock star without writing a line of code on your own or having to ask management to sign a check.


Attend this session and walk away with everything you need to generate documentation for your entire SQL Server environment on your first day back at the office

## Title: Performance Tuning - Analyzing Execution Plans
 
**Abstract**:
Did you ever get woken up at night from a call from a user screaming about poor query performance, but didn’t really know how to begin attack the problem?  In this session, we will explore the basics of execution plan analysis and how to single out issues that pertain to base table operations.
In this presentation, we will identify what indexes are being used by the SQL Optimizer, the different type of index operations that are performed by SQL Server and which operations are generally considered the preferred method of data retrieval. We will discuss how to determine if the indexes used by the Optimizer are optimal, according to best practices, and the exceptions to those cases.   Finally, we will cover the relationships between different types of index operations and joins within SQL Server, including how the SQL Optimizer determines which join type it will use, along with the pros and cons of each join operation

## Title: DANGER: The Art and Science of Presenting
 
**Abstract**:
Is there a great difference in the brain chemistry of someone fleeing a hungry mountain lion and someone presenting to a group of colleagues in a corporate board room? The answer is: NO. Over the past decade, a lot has been learned about the chemistry of the brain and why humans react the way we do to events in our environment. The concept of EQ (Emotional Intelligence) is a compelling and growing concept that applies this knowledge in a set of learnable, improvable skills for leading human beings. While EQ is often applied to corporate leadership, the parallels to presenting are fantastic. This session will explain the basics of EQ and demonstrate how you can apply it to make your presentations better in the following areas: * Crafting better slide decks * Preparing yourself for presenting * Delivering your content * Dealing with the unexpected Understanding and practicing the concepts of EQ can make your presentations a better experience for everyone in the room--including you.

## Title: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Automating Your BI Framework
 
**Abstract**:
Quite frankly, some aspects of building out a business intelligence solution are tedious. As you cycle through iterations of your star schema, you’ll find that even a simple data type change in the data warehouse requires you to make corresponding changes to staging tables, SSIS packages, and SSAS multidimensional or tabular models that take a considerable amount of time to implement. But there’s a better, faster way!In this session, we’ll explore lessons from a project that required implementation of a framework to easily generate BI objects based on reusable patterns. We’ll walk through the decision points in the framework design, review the implementation steps, and see demonstrations of how easily you can make iterative changes to your BI solution’s design by using reusable design patterns. Whether you simply want to accelerate change management or reproduce objects in bulk on demand, this session will give you practical tips for automating these processes.

## Title: Database Design: Size DOES Matter
 
**Abstract**:
Great database performance starts with great database design. During the database design process it is important to select your datatypes wisely. The wrong choices will often lead to wasted space, increased response times, and less stability. Additionally you run the risk of having your design not scale as well as it should. Leave this session armed with the knowledge you need to help your databases perform at their peak efficiency.

## Title: You Inherited a Database, Now What?
 
**Abstract**:
You have recently inherited the support of a new or existing database, what are the things you should immediately check and start monitoring and what are the things that you should address over the next few weeks. When taking over support of a database or system, you cannot ASSUME anything. At the end of this session you will have a nice checklist of things you should check and be doing on ALL your databases not just the one you inherited. Whether you are a seasoned DBA or just starting out, this session should be informative and something you can relate to.

## Title: Automate Your ETL Infrastructure with SSIS and PowerShell
 
**Abstract**:
Much of your ETL process flow consists of packages that are very similar in structure, capturing data from a single source and transferring that to a single destination.  Creating the individual packages can be tedious and it's easy to miss something in the process of generating the same basic package over and again.  BI Markup Language makes it easy to build new packages, and PowerShell makes creating the BIML scripts easy.  In this session we'll show you how to use PowerShell to generate dozens of SSIS packages doing similar tasks from a defined set of ETL sources.
