## Title: Extended Events in SQL Server 2008 and 2012
 
**Abstract**:
I will demonstrate practical examples of how to use Extended Events to figure out details of what SQL Server is doing when problems are occuring. You can dig deep into the internals of SQL Server with Extended Events since they track operations at a very low level. Extended Events were first introduced in SQL Server 2008 but have not been used that much because of the learning curve. SQL Server 2012 has promoted Extended Events to a much more important level. The feature is now ready to replace Profiler as the primary tool to gather real time details of query execution. The majority of my presentation will be demoing real world problem solving.

## Title: Rules, Rules, and Rules
 
**Abstract**:
Computers are governed by the rules of physics: electrons, drive heads, and disk platters can only move so fast. Understanding how these rules operate and interact leads to insights into application performance. Understanding why something might perform a certain way makes it much easier to understand the tradeoffs of a specific design.

Database systems are built according to those rules: memory is faster than disk which is faster than the network. Database schemas and queries are built within the rules of database systems. You will hit the limitations of these rules. If you know what the rules are and why they are in place, you'll know when it's time to break them... and how to succeed.

## Title: AlwaysOn – Way to get your 9’s?
 
**Abstract**:
We are always being told 9’s, 9’s  and more 9’s, but when implementation time comes to take action, technology / budget limitations get in the way, especially in the High Availability and Disaster Recovery (HA/DR) technology space.  Clustering and Mirroring are great and meet many of our needs, but there are some things we have wished for, such as a mirror database that is usable. AlwaysOn solves this limitation by merging both Mirroring and Multi-Node Multi-Subnet Clustering (True Geo-Clustering Support!!!).  AlwaysOn also allows the replica database to be used in a Read-Only capacity, so we can use it for reporting purposes. (Imagine that!)  Join us in providing a warm welcome to this new functionality with extensive demos.

## Title: Understanding SQL Server XML Features 
 
**Abstract**:
The XML Functionality embedded into SQL Server 2005 and 2008 is one of its most powerful yet least understood features.  This seems to be primarily because DBA's shy away from it and developers prefer to work with XML in their code.  In this session we will explore the XML features of SQL Server and how we can bridge these two worlds. Topics covered will include retrieving relational data as XML, storing XML in the database using the XML Datatype, XML indexes, and the XQuery functions included in SQL Server.  We will also look at using XML as stored procedure parameters as a way to pass large amounts of complex data between client and server.

## Title: The Performance Impact of Database Design
 
**Abstract**:
Time-travel stories all have one common plot element - some action done in the past has big impact on the future. Sometimes you get lucky… Hoverboards! Sometimes, not so much... Morlocks! The same holds true in your database. Design decisions have a huge impact on how you’re going to get data into and out of your database. This session illustrates the performance impact of common database design issues and proposes design alternatives that will help your database avoid an H.G. Wellsian future.

## Title: Understanding Parameter Sniffing
 
**Abstract**:
Parameter sniffing is a good thing: it is used by the Query Optimizer to produce an execution plan tailored to the current parameters of a query.
