## Title: Capture Change and Apply it With Change Data Capture  SSIS
 
**Abstract**:
Whether you are trying to setup a new data warehouse, keep it updated, audit changes to your databases or quickly load changes to another database Change Data Capture (CDC) is a solution for all of these and can now be setup and supported easily with SQL Server  SSIS 2012! Change Data Capture (CDC) has been around since SQL Server 2008, but has been underused because it was difficult to fully implement. SSIS 2012 now provides support for CDC with new components that make consuming the captured data very easy to apply. This session will define what CDC is and with live demos show how it is setup on your databases. Once it has been setup then you need to consume and apply those changes, this will be demonstrated with live demos using SSIS 2012 to create packages that apply the changes.

## Title: Getting Started with Execution Plans
 
**Abstract**:
There are times when you are able to be proactive and tune existing queries. Sometimes, you will receive a phone call from your manager telling you that a certain web page or report is timing out and your users are furious. You need to quickly diagnose what the problem is. Where do you turn to first? When a query is underperforming, hogging resources or timing out, one of the first things you want to examine is the query execution plan. An execution plan provides a wealth of information that can help you quickly diagnose what is wrong. In this beginner level session you will learn what an execution plan is, how to find it, and how to interpret it to see what the query optimizer is doing and find the major pain points.

## Title: Tabular Models
 
**Abstract**:
Tabular modules allow developers to create models based upon different data sources; create hierarchies, perspectives, partitions and roles similar to traditional OLAP cubes.  In this session will highlight the differences between traditional OLAP and tabular models and reasons for selecting one approach over another. I will demonstrate how to create a data model first in power pivot model and then import into an Analysis Services Tabular Project.  Working with the imported data I will then create measures, KPIs, perspectives, and implement security. Finally I will deploy the model to an Analysis Server.
