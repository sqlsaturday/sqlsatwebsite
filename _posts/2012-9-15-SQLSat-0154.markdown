## Title: Pivoting Performance Data  Pinpointing Problems
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever been wrought with end user complaints of database performance issues only to open your tools that show only live performance or limited historical performance and find no answers?  After being bit by this many times, I developed my own eye in the sky to monitor CPU  Physical IO at the database, user and application levels.  This solution logs data continuously and parses it into an Analysis Services cube which can be queried by Excel.  No need to requisition funds for 3rd party tools.  You can do this with the tools you have and I’ll give you the scripts to get started.  Using these tools I have been able to find needles in haystacks and effectively communicate the nature of the problems to people at all levels.

## Title: Database Design Done Right
 
**Abstract**:
From beginning to end application development is upside down.  So much emphasis is placed on the front end and so little on the analysis of database structure that many application development projects fail to achieve the goals set by the business.  This presentation uses an interwoven analogy to illustrate the process currently used by most enterprises, the results, and the short comings.  Yet with a change of focus, the same projects can not only be successful; they can be done under budget, with greater flexibility and extensibility.  Future projects can benefit from this change of focus with additional savings in timelines and fewer bug fixes downstream.  Any business person or data professional who works directly with business people c

## Title: PWNED! Security, SQL Server, and You!
 
**Abstract**:
With an ever increasing workload, security is often hoisted upon the DBA. So where do you start? Sometimes it's better to start off by understanding what an attacker could do to you in order to get a clearer picture of what you need to do to prevent it. In this session, we will delve into the key features of the SQL Server and explain what the various attack vectors are, what an attack can do with them, and what you can do about them. We'll also look at important features such as SQL Audit that, while not helping to prevent, can definitely help in figuring out what is going on. It'll be AWESOME!

Even Microsoft Kinect is getting in the act. Where there is growth, there is opportunity. This session will define the lingo and point out the trends in order to demystify the industry. I'll start with the big picture and drill down to the specifics. Together we'll navigate the trends and get excited about where all of this is going.

## Title: Read Dirty to Me - Isolation Levels/User Impact
 
**Abstract**:
Issue a "SELECT {data} FROM {myTable}" statement and users need to trust the data returned is accurate. What happens when multiple processes access the same data? What happens further if one of those process is an UPDATE or even a DELETE statement? How about if both processes will be updating that data? Understanding Isolation in SQL Server is paramount in ensuring data integrity in your system. We will cover the different levels of isolation and how they impact what a user views when accessing the data at a given point-in-time.
