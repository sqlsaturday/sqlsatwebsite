## Title: SQL Server 2019: The Modern Database Platform
 
**Abstract**:
In this session, we will cover the complete set of features and capabilities in SQL Server 2019. Want your queries to run faster with no application changes or watch your database recover in seconds? Need to connect to Oracle, CosmosDB, or Azure without moving data? Making a move to SQL Server 2019 could be the right choice for you.  SQL Server 2019 represents the next evolution of the leading database platform in the industry. "This is not your grandpa's SQL Server" says Travis Wright. Whether it is Big Data Clusters with Hadoop and Spark, Java, Linux, Containers, or Kubernetes. Pedro Lopes says it still is "Your grandpa's SQL Server" because of Intelligent Performance, Mission Critical Availability, and Security. Who is right? Come to this session and see for yourself.

## Title: Power BI + Microsoft Flow + PowerApps = Real Magic
 
**Abstract**:
BI is certainly about interactive reports and clever analysis, but for it to be truly valuable, your insights must easily be turned into actions. 

In this session we’ll explore how combining Power BI and two other Power Platform apps, namely Microsoft Flow and Microsoft PowerApps, we can turn BI into “insights AND action”.

We will walk through a popular use case of a Sales Rep visiting a client, and integrating Flow, PowerApps and Power BI on a tablet one can vastly improve customer satisfaction, significantly reduce workload and administration, and improve sales volumes.

Here are some of the things we’ll cover:
•	Validate stock levels on the spot to avoid ordering an out-of-stock item
•	Place orders directly from Power BI using Flow and PowerApps to integrate with your ERP system
•	Don’t miss out on any lost opportunities by viewing past order history using insightful Power BI visuals
•	Trigger workflows automatically instead of completing the admin later
•	CRM Integration

## Title: Design Strategies and Advanced Data Visualization: The Ingredients for a Delicious Data Story
 
**Abstract**:
You’re comfortable with picking the right visualization for a specific data set, and making it look good. You know the basics of design and can craft a report that is pleasing on the eye. Now it’s time to take your data presentation skills to the next level.

In this session, we will learn how to design for accessibility, allowing more people to benefit from our work. We’ll learn the difference between designing for users to explore information, and for users to consume insights. This will lead us into the basics of constructing a data story. From choosing the relevant data points, to removing all unnecessary distractions and constructing a cohesive narrative.

Every data story is unique, but the techniques for effective data presentation are universal. Improve your reports, dashboards, and slide decks by learning the art and science of quality data visualization.

## Title: Data Estate Modernization : Taking the guess work out of migrating to the cloud.
 
**Abstract**:
Moving to the cloud should not be difficult. Most organizations make the mistake of wanting to modernize their applications and databases on-prem first before moving to cloud. This is normally very expensive, leads to delays and often abandonment of projects.

In this session we will look at :
How to take the guess work out of developing a cloud roadmap. 
Look at how cost effective cloud will be in a very accurate manner.
How to assess applications and their dependencies.
Reduce time to cloud by telling exactly which lines of code to change in your applications and databases.
Effort estimation to complete each task.
Including 3 migration options in Microsoft Azure for your applications and databases.

## Title: Working with data in Python for Beginners
 
**Abstract**:
Data Science is the latest Data Buzz word, but what does this mean for us the Analysts and Developers. Well, this is just another opportunity to grow and learn a new skill. The great thing about the era we live in is that information is everywhere but can be a little overwhelming for someone who is just starting off in a new field or wants to learn a new skill.

In this session, we will use Python in an easy to understand layout by using Notebooks as our Interface and pandas as our data manipulation library in Python. This session is for everyone that is just starting off in Python. We will learn how to import/export data into Python as well as manipulate and analyse data. Finally, we will look at how to bring this back into our SQL Server world.

## Title: Data wrangling using Power Query and M language
 
**Abstract**:
In the age of Self-Service analytics. We often have to deal with "raw" data. 

Using Power Query and M language one can define a step by step process of transforming and mapping data from one "raw" data form into another format with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes such as analytics. 

The final transformed dataset is available one can use it to create visualizations that can be added to Power BI reports and publish to the Power BI service.

M stands for Data Mashup and M is a functional language.

In this session, I will demonstrate around 30 Things that one can do with Power Query

## Title: Profiling Your Data
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever started a warehouse or ETL project and realized that the data wasn't as "clean" as you were told?  If only you had profiled your data before you started then you wouldn't have to rework design elements, change code or redesign your database.  In this session we will talk about what data profiling is, why you should do it and how you can do it with tools that are already included in the SQL Server BI stack.

## Title: Web Scraping
 
**Abstract**:
There's a wealth of data available on the internet which can be used for data augmentation or to create entirely new datasets. The data might all be on one page (if you're lucky!) or distributed across multiple (possibly hundreds or thousands) pages. Web scraping allows you to gather those data and consolidate them in a convenient format. This will be a hands-on tutorial in R, so bring your machine and follow along.

## Title: A Beginners guide to Data Modeling
 
**Abstract**:
"Data is the new oil" - Everyone
 
It's a statement we've all heard before. No doubt people are realizing just how valuable data is becoming. Ultimately though for data to be valuable it needs to be usable.  With the growth of new technologies like AI, Data Lakes, IOT to name a few the modelling of data is even more important than ever.
Stop your data lakes from turning into data swamps.
 
This session will cover the basic terminology and methods of modelling data. It will also show some of the most common models and what they are best suited for.

MCSA and MCT in SQL Data Platforms, I am passionate about all things data. I also have a particular love for new innovative solutions to deal with the big data problem. 

I have been using SQL for 9 years professionally from SQL 2003 and more recently SQL 2016 CTP2.1. I have also been fortunate enough to work and develop extensively on SQL 2012 Parallel Data Warehouse through a Microsoft Analytic Platforms System.
