## Title: 2,4,8  16 - Visualise your data platform upgrade journey with SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
2,4,8  16 - these aren't just numbers to count or calculate. These are years that how SQL Server evolved as number of years!

Why Upgrade? 
Data Platform Upgrade topic has been a popular session that I've presented in major conferences like Microsoft Tech-Ed (North America, Europe  India) and SQLbits since 2008. 

In this session, we will overview in depth end-to-end upgrade process that covers the essential phases, steps and issues involved in upgrading  SQL Server (2000 to  2012),  SQL Server 2014 (with a good overview on 2016 too) by using best practices and available resources. 

What to-do and what not-to-do?

A popular session that I have been presenting since the year 2008, in MS Tech-Ed, SQLSaturday  SQLbits UK.
We will cover the an end-to-end upgrade cycle, including the preparation tasks, upgrade tasks, and post-upgrade tasks. Real-world data store and examples from my Consulting experience expanding on why  how such a solution.

## Title: Test Driven Development in SQL Server – how to deploy code safer
 
**Abstract**:
Test Driven Development (TDD)  is a design approach which has enabled application developers to write cleaner code. 
It is relevant for database development as it ensures that code produced using TDD and unit tests will be of higher quality which means interactions with data will be safer. 
TDD is not a new method of unit testing, it is an essential design practice for improving the quality of your deployed code.
In this session it will be shown how we can use TDD to design and write better unit tests using open-source frameworks and industry standard tools. These tools can be run within SQL Server Management Studio which means DBAs can also take advantage of TDD and unit test, to ensure more reliable code is deployed to databases. 
TDD can result in code that can be deployed more reliably and faster when using DevOps processes such as Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. 
A comprehensive DEMO will reveal how Test Driven Development can help you deploy database code safer.

## Title: Taming of the Shrew - Optimizing Power BI
 
**Abstract**:
No one wants to tell a report user that while running a report in Power BI they have time to go get a cup of coffee…in another town.  Although data sets will often be the focus of performance issues, it’s important to know how to locate performance problems in Power BI and how to eliminate them.  

This session will take the Power User through how to identify time consuming processing in Power BI and how to address it through step-by-step and proven methods used to optimize in multi-tier environments.  This method removes frustration and finger-pointing and gets to the heart of the problem with a goal of correcting performance challenges.  The results are satisfied end users who get the information they need, when they need it.

Take Aways:
Learn how to identify what is taking the time in a Power BI data set and report.
Understand the logging and tracing mechanisms and capabilities in the environment.
Understand when a problem is really a problem.

## Title: DevOps 101 for Data People
 
**Abstract**:
In 2009 John Allspaw and Paul Hammond delivered the session "10 deploys per day - Dev  ops cooperation at Flickr." In forty six minutes they changed the way millions of people would think about the software delivery process for years to come. It didn't have a name yet, but DevOps was born. DevOps folk preached about the cloud, automation, rapid delivery and any database technology that wasn't relational.
 
In 2013 Kenny Gorman declared "The DBA is Dead".
 
For the record, I don't believe that, but a lot of people do. What is certain is that the world of IT is changing and traditional roles are changing with it. We all need to adapt.
 
In this interactive talk I'll explain what DevOps is, where it came from, and its implications for SQL Server. I'll demo example solutions to some of the foundational technical challenges (source control and test/deployment automation) and will leave plenty of time at the end to answer your questions.

## Title: Introduction to Azure AI - The Art of the possible
 
**Abstract**:
According to the Economist magazine, data is the world’s most valuable resource.  So, it makes sense that Data Science, Azure Machine Learning, and Analytics are all becoming core pieces to the success of every business.  As data professionals, we need to know how these core pieces will affect what we do, and how we can use the Azure AI suite to help our clients.  Microsoft’s AI suite is the central hub for learning and implementing each of these core pieces.  Using an easy to follow example, I will show the flow from problem to solution.  Multiple demonstrations of the different pieces will show use cases of the AI suite.  This overview of Azure AI will use the various pieces like a puzzle which, when brought together, will form a seamless picture of the whole so that participants can see that the individual pieces were meant to work together.

## Title: On Transactions and Atomic Operations
 
**Abstract**:
"If there’s one thing that we, as SQL developers don’t do, it’s use transactions as often as we should.

Transactions are critical when multiple changes need to be made entirely or not at all, but even given that it’s rare to see transactions used at all in most production code

In this session, we’ll look at what transactions are and why we should use them. We’ll explore the effects transactions have on locking and the transaction log. We’ll investigate methods of handling errors and undoing data modifications, and we’ll see why nested transactions are a lie.

1) Understand what transactions are and what they do.

2) Learn how to use transactions in combination with error handling to roll back changes on errors

3) Learn how transactions affect logging and locking.

## Title: Using Columnstore indexes in Azure DevOps Services. Lessons learned
 
**Abstract**:
The Analytics service in Azure DevOps Services provides all-over insights to your DevOps data: work item tracking, CI/CD pipelines, testing process etc. 
	 
Built on top of columnstore indexes, the Analytics service has to deal with 100s of millions records and daily growth in 10s of millions, only a few minutes delay from operation store, sub second query performance for in-product experiences as well as 3rd party extensions, Power BI integration and ad-hoc queries.
	 
Working on it, I've learned a lot of DOs and DON'Ts about columnstore indexes. Session covers how to:
* partition columnstore indexes in a multitenant environment
* maintain columnstore indexes in case of updates and/or purge to keep segment elimination possible
* evolve database schema without downtimes and maintenance windows
* design to benefit from predicate and aggregation pushdown
* deal with edge case like ad-hoc queries for raw data and paging
* choose between CCI and NCCI based on usage patterns

## Title: Predictive Analytics with R in Power BI
 
**Abstract**:
Power BI reports are typically used for descriptive analysis: a historical look of what has happened. But what if your report could visualize what is likely to happen and recommend what you can do about it now? This session will cover how to shift from descriptive to predictive analysis and leverage the power of machine learning to enhance your business intelligence solutions. The basics and best practices of predictive modeling will be introduced, and these concepts will be applied to create three predictive models in R using three different techniques. We will then walk through the three different ways to integrate the predictive power of these models into a Power BI report.

## Title: Why Solidity is Solid – Basics of Ethereum, Smart Contracts, and Blockchain.
 
**Abstract**:
If you are into Ethereum or any latest Blockchain platform you may know the availability of “smart contract language (SCL)” comes easily. In this foundational quick talk, I will be introducing my audiences to a newer coding platform in Blockchain. We know that any RELATIONAL language/platform is legacy and solid when it comes to prevalence. But if you are open to experiment and broaden your understanding to a Blockchain world with the new-cutting-age-y languages, feel free to join my session. 
Topics that I will cover in this session – 
1.	What is Ethereum Blockchain (A, B, Cs of it.)
2.	Overview of NEO platform  Solidity language
3.	What are ‘Smart Contracts’
4.	Python, C++ Vs Solidity, Language of Smart Contract
5.	Last but not least, if you attend my session and do NOT understand ‘a thing’ I am speaking; you will still get a ton of ‘reference materials’ that I have been gaining from many over-priced Blockchain courses conducted by multi-millionaires, geeks.

## Title: Demystifying Chart Types and Report Design Principles in Power BI
 
**Abstract**:
Failing to deliver a well-designed Power BI Report is perhaps the most common reporting pitfall.  What good is quality data if it is not presented in a way that is meaningful or easily understood? Someone without any prior knowledge should be able to quickly understand a report without explanation and be quickly drawn to the key elements you want them to view.  This talk will walk through many elements of bad report design. Learn about visual cues and how certain chart types can convey data more accurately than others. Also, learn about the basic dos and don’ts of report design and layout, using easy-to-learn techniques that bring data to life.

## Title: Be Friendly to SQL Server with TSQL Best Practices
 
**Abstract**:
TSQL is a necessity when interacting with SQL Server so knowing can be half the battle. Performance is always good as the database starts to grow, but building in resilience when you begin is a greater advantage than refactoring. I will go over 5 key things to know when you write TSQL, use DataTypes and/or variables in comparisons and you will also learn about the procedure cache and how to avoid pitfalls there. This is a beginners session but the concepts in this session are a great foundation to begin with. If you are looking for a solid foundation to build on and need the basics to start, this session is definitely for you.

## Title: TSQL User Defined Functions – Taboo or not?
 
**Abstract**:
For years user defined functions (UDFs) have been the nemesis of the DBA focused on performance, but they have been loved by developers due to their ability to help with code re-usability and abstraction of business rules.
SQL Server 2019 introduces techniques that help eliminate some of the performance issues related to UDFs. Learn how and in what cases scalar UDF In-lining can improve your performance reducing the historic performance problems with UDFs.
We will explore how in-lining improves performance, along with what you can do and what prevents in-lining of UDFs.

## Title: Don't Use Cursors or Why You Maybe Should Use a Cursor After All
 
**Abstract**:
You might have heard "don't use cursors, they are slow!". In this presentation, you will learn what this actually means: you should normally write set-based statements instead and I will explain why they generally are faster than writing your own loops. But I will also look at situations where using a loop for one reason or another is preferrable, and you will learn that the best way to run a loop in most cases is exactly a cursor, provided that you implement it properly. The presenation also gives some tips how you can troubleshoot performance problems with loops.

## Title: Antipattern Assumptions in Data
 
**Abstract**:
While we are engineers, we are still people full of assumptions, biases and unchecked preconceptions about society and other people.  This impacts our design patterns for software and databases. When we design architecture that is limited based on our assumptions, we can find our products limiting and creating user experience problems.  In this session, we will discuss common antipattern assumptions that cause these limitations in our architecture design.  We will also talk through the importance of creating a diverse team to help broaden perspectives and increase innovation which can help counter these antipatterns to pave the way for higher quality products.
