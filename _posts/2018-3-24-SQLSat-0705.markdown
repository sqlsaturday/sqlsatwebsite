## Title: Controlling Competing Workloads with SQL Server Resource Governor
 
**Abstract**:
With heavily consolidated instances and competing workloads, the Enterprise only Resource Governor feature is an incredibly useful tool for any DBA to have in their toolbox. It allows for the effective throttling and control of CPU, memory and I/O consumed by multiple workloads running on a single SQL Server instance. In this session, we will cover the fundamental concepts of the SQL Server Resource Governor and provide demonstrations of practical scenarios where Resource Governor can control resources for specific workloads. Some of these demonstrations include how to limit the amount of memory consumed by memory-optimized tables and how to prevent poorly-written queries from overwhelming your storage subsystem. We will also discuss cases where Resource Governor can mitigate parameter sniffing problems. Finally, we will look at ways to leverage the useful information contained in the Resource Governor DMVs for monitoring and reporting.

## Title: Why Should I Care About ... Partitioned Views?
 
**Abstract**:
Partitioned tables are awesome and partitioned views are dead, right? Well, sure partitioned views are not sexy but there are still plenty of applications where they are critical. And not necessarily just for standard edition who aren't on the new service pack yet. If your data is time stamped, do you see different queries run against older data than new data? Do you with you could segment your data across multiple columns? Do you have data you need to partition horizontally? It's possible partitioned views may still be for you. Come hear why this is still an important topic long after cargo pants and trucker hats went away ... and possibly even after 2016 SP1.

## Title: 5 Minute No Sweat SQL Security Audits
 
**Abstract**:
Security audits such as PCI, STIG, or HIPAA, are important and can be complicated. Depending on the requirements it may take considerable time to gather the information you will need.
In this session, you will get scripts that I use for compliance audits that help to collect the information required for many different audits quickly. Even when you have multiple SQL Servers, you can quickly and easily identify where to focus your efforts to ensure you pass security audits. Through demonstration and discussion of what and why certain items get reviewed you will leave with a better understanding of how to be compliant within you SQL Server environment.

## Title: Using Columnstore Indexes For Data Analytics
 
**Abstract**:
The concept of convenience typically involves ease of use and/or the ability to get results fast while maintaining quality and integrity.  The industry of business intelligence and data analytics has been changing and evolving with this same concept in mind. 

The traditional data warehouse includes various implementation and development phases that can be both costly and time consuming to architect.  Although a viable solution for analytics based on query speed and performance, one of the biggest drawbacks is data latency from the OLTP engine to the OLAP engine.  First introduced in SQL Server 2012, Columnstore indexes have made great strides in SQL Server 2016.

In this session, we will cover the architecture of columnstore indexes compared to traditional B-tree indexes.  We will look at specific use case scenarios and performance statistics to understand if columnstore indexes can be your solution for data analytics with or without a traditional data warehouse.

## Title: Choosing Sides in the ETL vs ELT Debate
 
**Abstract**:
The debate regarding the relative merits of extract transform load (ETL) and extract load transform (ELT) data migration strategies isn’t new, but it remains relevant. Making the right choice is critical, because the wrong solution will slow development cycles and execution times, and increase the cost and complexity of code maintenance.  In this presentation, I’ll cover some best practices for implementing an ELT solution for a variety of data migration scenarios.  Data enthusiasts of any level will benefit from a detailed discussion of methodologies, strategic benefits, and code examples.  The discussion will focus on the SQL Server stack including Azure and code examples will use T-SQL and SSIS.

## Title: Data Protection  Privacy in the World of Database DevOps
 
**Abstract**:
Ensuring the ongoing protection of personally identifiable information is mandatory in today's business, helping you to guard against data breaches, and comply with the GDPR. In a climate where cyber attacks are all too frequent, and data is spread across a growing number of different environments, the challenge of protecting your data can seem daunting.  This session will address the implications of the GDPR on database management, and demonstrate a privacy-first approach to controlling and protecting data as it changes and moves through your SQL Server estate. As well as offering guidance for assessing your data estate for GDPR readiness, this session will include some great tools and tips for building data protection and privacy into your development processes, and dispel the myth that database DevOps and compliance can't go hand in hand. With the right preparation, you can build compliance into your processes, keep sensitive data safe, and deliver value quickly to your end users.

## Title: A Masters Passport to Extended Events
 
**Abstract**:
"As is commonly the case, all good things come to an end.  And now is as good a time as any for the use of SQL Trace and Profiler to come to an end.  Let’s face it, Trace was a good tool and had some wonderful uses.  Profiler for that matter was a good tool and was useful at times.
It is time to let those old tools retire gracefully and move into the world of XE.  This workshop will provide you the means to let Profiler and Trace be retired from your toolset as you discover all that XE has to offer.

This session on Extended Events will help prepare you to put this tool to immediate use as you walk back to your daily duties.  This workshop will teach you about Extended Events starting with the basics and moving through how to create XE sessions that will get the right data for you, while doing so with minimal impact.

You will be exposed to advanced troubleshooting techniques as we work through complex issues that are made easier through the use of XE.  Take advantage

## Title: Extending DevOps To SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Most organizations are under pressure to speed up the software delivery cycle, whether that’s to respond more quickly to the needs of the business, the needs of your customers or just to keep up with the competition.  Unfortunately the database is commonly considered a bottleneck.  Without the right processes in place, database change management can slow things down, adding risk, uncertainty, and getting in the way of development and operations working together to deliver.  Any organization that wants to fully benefit from a DevOps approach is going to have to overcome some specific challenges presented by the database. This session will teach you how to take DevOps principles and practices and apply them to SQL Server so that you can speed up the database delivery cycle at the same time you protect the information contained within.

## Title: TempDB 101 Plus
 
**Abstract**:
TempDB is not your ordinary user database and should definitely not be treated like one.  The usage patterns dictate that the configuration, monitoring and usage be done in a different way to get the best performance. We will see why aspects such as configuration and file placement play such a key role and why you need to plan ahead for TempDB.  See how to detect the memory and space usage associated with the various users in TempDB along with some of the most common performance related scenarios that you will encounter with a well-used TempDB database.  In addition we will explain the differences between temp tables and table variables and when to use one over another.

## Title: Instrument your code – Basic TSQL Logging
 
**Abstract**:
Well-instrumented code not only helps others with troubleshooting our code but it also helps with performance analysis and provides a good audit of runs over time. In this session we will explore a small framework for TSQL Logging that is easy to use and generic enough to fit simple and advanced use-cases. We will see how we can track messages, errors  duration of runs by code type without intruding on the functionality of common/shared code and how this functionality may be shared across databases with a single code base. Tying DMV’s to business logic side of what is in-flight, is covered. All of the code will be available for use in your own projects. Let us see how you can get your code instrumented on
Day 1!

## Title: Collecting and Analyzing File  Wait Statistics
 
**Abstract**:
Is your SQL Server instance running at its peak performance level?  Probably not but the real question is do you know why? Is your disk subsystem too slow or are you lacking enough CPU’s or is it something else entirely? It is very easy to capture and analyze the file  wait stat information that is automatically collected by the SQL Server instance so why not utilize them. We will see how you can stop chasing your tail and focus on which area of SQL Server performance bottlenecks are doing you the most harm. This should be part of every DBA’s arsenal so come make it part of yours as well.

## Title: SQL Server on Linux for SQL DBA.
 
**Abstract**:
For the last 25 years SQL Server DBAs administered SQL databases using only Windows GUI.
For majority of them even Windows Core is too hard to accept.
In the situation, when Microsoft invaded Linux territory with it's flagship product, as SQL DBA, you must not outsource SQL Server administration to some Linux geeks. 
You can do it yourself!
Your way!
And I show you how to do it.

## Title: Faster SSIS
 
**Abstract**:
Ever wonder why SSIS runs so slow? Watch SSIS author Andy Leonard as he runs test loads using sample and real-world data and shows you how to tune SQL Server 2016 Integration Services (SSIS 2016) packages.

We'll start by experimenting with SSIS design patterns to improve performance loading AdventureWorks data. We will implement different change detection patterns and compare execution performance for each. Then, we'll explain a Data Flow Task's bottleneck when loading binary large objects - or Blobs. 

Finally, we'll demonstrate a design pattern that uses a Script Component in a Data Flow to boost load performance to MySql, whether on-premises or in the cloud.

## Title: SQL Restore: Optimizing Your Data Recovery
 
**Abstract**:
When disaster strikes, everyone's immediate question becomes: How long until the system is back online?  Whether it's a single database or the whole SQL environment, time is essential... As everyone waits on the restore to complete. 

How long will the restoration process take?  
Can it run faster? 

In this session, we'll answer these questions by looking at how to establish and maintain a Restoration Baseline and the options available for performance tuning database restores.

## Title: Working Effectively With Legacy SQL
 
**Abstract**:
A legacy code base can be a frightening thing.  Between strict deadlines, ever-evolving requirements, differing skill levels of contributors over time, and historical circumstances, keeping database code clean and concise is difficult at best.  This example- and demo-driven talk will help you build out a mental framework to prune those gnarled code bases.  Much of this talk will be familiar to software developers who know of the "clean code" philosophy, but no knowledge of the topic is necessary.  If you shudder whenever you look at your SQL code base, this talk may be for you.

**Abstract**:
Graphs are everywhere!  Microsoft has added a lot of new features to SQL Server 2017, and among them SQL Graph has been one - one that holds a lot of promises, though it's still in its early stages (at least with Microsoft products).  Microsoft recently added Graph DB to their DocumentDB (product) and released it as Cosmos DB.  In this session, we'll take a look at what this feature brings to the table, and how it compares with other Graph databases.

## Title: Would You Just Load Already?!  Maximizing Your SSIS Data Load
 
**Abstract**:
Loading data via SSIS is great! It’s fast too! Until you hit a bad record. Then things aren’t so great. Now you probably have to waste time dumping and reloading all the data, or worst figure out where the bad record is and try a partial load.
In this session you will learn a simple method to load data via SSIS and identify, remove, and record those bad records allowing you to maximize the amount of data loaded while ensuring data integrity.
