## Title: Relational databases vs Non-relational databases
 
**Abstract**:
There is a lot of confusion about the place and purpose of the many recent non-relational database solutions (“NoSQL databases”) compared to the relational database solutions that have been around for so many years.  In this presentation I will first clarify what exactly these database solutions are, how they compare to Hadoop, and discuss the best use cases for each.  I’ll discuss topics involving ACID vs BASE, scaling, data warehousing, polyglot persistence, CAP theorem, and SQL Server 2016 and PolyBase.  We will even touch on a new type of database solution called NewSQL.  If you are building a new solution it is important to understand all your options so you take the right path to success.

## Title: Tips that have saved my bacon
 
**Abstract**:
In this session, I propose to share some of the tricks I've used on the operational side of being a DBA.

There's saying, never perform small miracles, people to rely on them, but isn't it useful to have a few in your back-pocket. 

Everyone knows log-shipping is great for DR recovery, but what about using it for minor issues, like a delete or update gone bad? Want to move a large table someplace else (like that "oh it'll just be a small audit table, it won't grow large because we'll write the functionality later to keep it small" and they never do? UNC backups... an often overlooked but useful option for making a backup AND getting it off your server. Run a small operation where too many fingers have access to the operational DB and you want to catch them? These are some of the tricks I've picked up over the years and used more than once to perform small miracles and have saved my bacon or the bacon of others

## Title: Migrating a Disk-based Table to a Memory-optimized Table
 
**Abstract**:
In-Memory OLTP table was first introduced in SQL Server 2014. However, a massive number of limitations makes In-Memory OLTP table usage practically impossible. In SQL Server 2016 many of those limitations were eliminated which made it possible to start implementing In-Memory OLTP table in the database. The session 'Migrating a Disk-based Table to a Memory-optimized Table' will cover the process of migrating the disk tables to In-Memory OLTP table. This process is not straight forward and requires analysis before making a final decision for migration. However, the benefits of In-Memory OLTP table is worth the effort. If you are looking to improve transaction speed and reduce blocking for your server, the In-Memory OLTP tables is an excellent way to accomplish this task.

## Title: Setting up BI Infrastructure: Points to consider
 
**Abstract**:
Imagine if you had to setup the BI infrastructure from scratch. Success of a good BI infrastructure is measured by two most important factors by the users: Better access to data and increased operational efficiency. 
We shall discuss selection of vendors and technology. We will learn about various components of BI infrastructure, their HA/DR scenarios. We shall also learn about the best practices involved therein. We will also discuss whether to outsource this project or rise above our DBA job and do it ourselves. 
We will also briefly discuss how Copy Data Virtualization helps us to provide data/information quickly to the BI team to turn around reports quickly.  
Evolution of the cloud has really changed the lay of the BI land. We will talk about On-Prem, cloud hosted or hybrid solutions. We will take a quick look at the Power BI where the Power of BI is back in the hands of the users.
At the end of the session you will have a complete information about an ideal BI Infrastructure.

## Title: Who's flying the plane? What IT can learn from plane crashes
 
**Abstract**:
Why do some planes with very few issues crash while a plane with no engine power can land safely on the Hudson with no loss of life?

Every company will eventually have a disaster. It's just a matter of size and scope. This talk is a general overview of how to respond to an incident and talks about the roles of management and IT. 

This is not your typical discussion of disasters focusing on how to make a backup plan or enable high availability.

I'll touch upon what we can learn from plane crashes and how those lessons can be applied to the IT environment in general.

## Title: Tech Writing for Techies: A Primer
 
**Abstract**:
Documentation is one of the most critical, yet most blatantly ignored and disrespected tasks when it comes to technology.  Businesses and technical professionals ignore documentation at their own risk.  This session discusses what tech writing and documentation is about and why it's critical for business.  It also explores possible reasons for why it's ignored, how documentation can be improved, and how "non-writers" can contribute to the process.

## Title: Agile Data Modeling with Data Vault
 
**Abstract**:
Agility and Business Intelligence are two good things that often struggle to be good together. A primary cause of this struggle is the inability of traditional Data Warehouse models to respond to change in a (business) timely manner. Data Vault is an evolution of Enterprise Data Warehouse modeling that removes the barriers to Data Warehouse agility. A Data Vault warehouse eliminates re-engineering both of the data schema and ETL as the model evolves in response to changing business needs and definitions.
In this session we’ll compare modeling techniques in real world scenarios to understand how Data Vault can make your EDW more capable and agile.

## Title: Learning to present and becoming good at it
 
**Abstract**:
Have you been thinking about presenting at a user group?  Are you being asked to present at your work?  Is learning to present one of the keys to advancing your career?  Or do you just think it would be fun to present but you are too nervous to try it?  Well take the first step to becoming a presenter by attending this session and I will guide you through the process of learning to present and becoming good at it.  It's easier than you think!  I am an introvert and was deathly afraid to speak in public.  Now I love to present and it's actually my main function in my job at Microsoft.  I'll share with you journey that lead me to speak at major conferences and the skills I learned along the way to become a good presenter and to get rid of the fear.  You can do it!

## Title: Disaster Documents: The role of documentation in disaster recovery
 
**Abstract**:
I was an employee of a company that had an office in the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001.  Prior to that infamous date, I had written several departmental documents that ended up being critical to our recovery.  In this presentation, I provide a narrative of what happened in the weeks following 9/11, and how documentation played a role in getting the organization back on its feet.

While other disaster recovery presentations talk about strategies, plans, and techniques, this presentation focuses on the documentation itself.  We will discuss the documents we had and how they were used in our recovery.  We will also discuss what documents we didn't have, and how they could have made the process better.

## Title: Statistics  Cardinality – How They Work to Find Data Efficiently
 
**Abstract**:
Are your statistics up to date? 
Yes, it’s that dreaded phrase you hear all the time when it comes to performance tuning your SQL Server. What does it matter? Why should I care about statistics? Aren’t they automatic or something like that?
In this session we will go over why statistics matter, how they are generated, how they impact performance, and even how to maintain them. Once we have that all settled, we will take a quick look at how the cardinality estimator uses statistics to determine a ‘good enough’ plan to use. We will close out the session by taking a look at the performance impact from a simple upgrade of your SQL Server to 2014 and using the new cardinality estimator.

## Title: Take the changes under control
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server does not support source safe control as the .NET application does. However, utilizing DDL trigger events makes it possible to capture when database users, either one DBA or Developer, create, alter and drop the SQL Server objects. This session demonstrates the complete solution on how to set up SQL Server source safe control, log any changes and roll back to any historical point of changes.

## Title: SELECT Provider FROM Cloud
 
**Abstract**:
Are you starting to think that this cloud thing may actually take off?  Perhaps it has become your responsibility to look for a cloud provider to meet the data needs of your employer/client or you want to be ready in case someone asks.  In this session, we will spend a few moments defining Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) before moving on to a brief discussion regarding cloud objections and misconceptions.  Finally, we reach our destination, a conversation based in the classic high school essay test question “Compare and Contrast” concerning data centric services in AWS and Azure.  The focus of this session is available features not necessarily how to use them.

## Title: Network your Way to Success!
 
**Abstract**:
Did you know that most employers  -- whether looking for a full time employee, contractor, or consultant – interview people because of their technical skills and experiences, but hire and keep them for their social capital?  In times of economic downturn, it’s not the person who is the most competent who stays; it’s the one who’s most competent, likeable, and connected.   Socially adept people also get invited to the table more often for big projects and are promoted (or extended) more frequently than purely ‘competent’ individuals. 

Whether or not you’ve been in your role for a few months, years, or even decades – or you’re looking for a new job and new opportunities -- strategic networking is the way to make yourself more relevant, more attractive for projects and promotion – or more hirable by potential customers.  

Join us for an interactive session to strategize the best actions to increase your social capital and network your way to success!

## Title: From Analyst BI Day to Developer BI Night
 
**Abstract**:
You are a data analyst by trade. Your SQL skills are likely used to write research queries, do quality control for the query results, and churning out reports. However, you're now concerned with loading and manipulating data in the database. You're now asked to write statements that don't start with SELECT. In short, you're becoming a junior SQL developer.

This session will provide you with some high-level essential resources, from additional T-SQL query operators to SQL Server Data Tools and what relational database concepts, to help you navigate this uncharted territory...coming from a speaker who has been in the same position. You will come out of the session eager to use these resources to moonlight as or transition to a developer in the SQL Server space, ideally blending this developing skill set with your analyst skill set to create a well-rounded data professional!

## Title: Service Broker - Async In the DB
 
**Abstract**:
For years we searched for a solution to better manage the synchronous database logic in our legacy application.  Between triggers and stored procedures, basic transactions got slower and contention increased.  If only we had a free, always available solution within SQL Server to help us make some of these processes asynchronous! Through a twist of fate we (re)discovered Service Broker in the last year and have found it to be a great solution to solve some long-standing problems.

In this session I'll take a look at this "older" technology introduced with SQL 2005. I'll discuss what it is, how it can be used as a local database messaging queue, and how it can effectively allow you to do asynchronous trigger and stored procedure logic that wasn't previously possible.

You'll leave with ideas of how to refactor existing logic and setup your first SSB conversation. We'll also cover some of the initial pitfalls many people run into and considerations for using SSB in larger environments.

## Title: Introduction to Unit-Testing in SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
It’s bad enough to spend hours finding and fixing database defects, explaining to the rest of the team what went wrong and trying to clean up the mess. It’s even worse when a defect causes the end-user to make a bad decision. Database defects are far too costly and most testing practices do not adequately detect or prevent them.

In this session you’ll learn techniques to write SQL code that is resilient to defects and is easier to change and maintain. We will cover writing simple unit tests and look into more advanced topics such as faking tables and spying procedures. We will also look at how unit testing improves code quality and maintainability.

You will leave this session ready to write unit tests for your own environment to get started on the way to a defect-free and maintainable SQL Server code base.

## Title: Slay the Legacy Leviathan... Without Modifying Application Code
 
**Abstract**:
Do you have that nagging feeling that your SQL Server database could be serving you better than it is?  Does the original design date back more than 5-8 years?  Do you keep hoping you could move your legacy database to the cloud but can't even get the performance you would like out of your managed hosting environment?  We've been there too! 

In this session I'll give a brief history of our SQL Server journey that started way back with version 6.5 and then I'll size up our installed user base to set the stage.  Then we'll jump right into demonstrating the process we've taken to re-tool the database in ways that have improved performance, maintenance, and user experience… all without changing application code!  You'll learn how to rethink your indexing scheme, naming standards,  tools like Service Broker and Temporal Tables, server setup practices, and how to log metrics that matter.

This session will give you hope and inspire you to start your own "modernizing" journey!

## Title: Why should I care about ... the plan cache?
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this installment of Rick's "Why should I care" series, he lays out a case for why working knowledge of the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments. A review of relevant views and functions is included for the (newly?) motivated audience.

Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why their DBAs drink in the morning (allegedly). This is not a deep dive into the cache, it really is primarily a session exploring _why_ these DMOs are worth slogging through.

## Title: Securing and Managing access to your DW data
 
**Abstract**:
Managing who is able to access and retrieve data in your database is paramount to an organization.  How do we protect data from prying eyes, or individuals whose roles simply do not and should not have access to certain data?  We will look at techniques to secure and restrict access, and release of data to those who should receive it.  Taking real life scenarios, we will apply row level security, dynamic data masking, database roles, schemas, security groups, and other considerations to manage secure and manage access to your data.

## Title: Would You Just Load Already?!  Maximizing Your SSIS Data Load
 
**Abstract**:
Loading data via SSIS is great! It’s fast too! Until you hit a bad record. Then things aren’t so great. Now you probably have to waste time dumping and reloading all the data, or worst figure out where the bad record is and try a partial load.

In this session you will learn a simple method to load data via SSIS and identify, remove, and record those bad records allowing you to maximize the amount of data loaded while ensuring data integrity.

## Title: SQL Server on Linux for SQL DBA.
 
**Abstract**:
For the last 25 years SQL Server DBAs administered SQL databases using only Windows GUI.
For majority of them even Windows Core is too hard to accept.
In the situation, when Microsoft invaded Linux territory with it's flagship product, as SQL DBA, you must not outsource SQL Server administration to some Linux geeks. 
You can do it yourself!
Your way!
And I show you how to do it.

## Title: Finding more space for your tight environment.
 
**Abstract**:
If you do not have enough disk space and do not want buy more space, one way to get more space is compress the tables and also do some house keeping.

I am going use T-SQL script to generate script to compress each tables and release the free space by shrinking the datafiles.
And in the final I will defrag the indexes and update the statistics, since shrink datafile is not fragmentation aware task.

Rick will work with all things relational, but most enjoys helping smaller companies get better performance from MSSQL, as well as smoothing over relationships between DBA and development teams.
