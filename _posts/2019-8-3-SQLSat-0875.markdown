## Title: T-SQL Performance Guidelines for the optimal DB stress powers
 
**Abstract**:
To reach your desired business functionalities, it can be easy using some common T-SQL practices like MTVF , scalar functions , Temp tables, Union…etc and they might perform pretty well on development server coz neither adequate stress of users nor adequate volume of data exist there but actually they seem totally strange once going to live where they become performing badly ending up eventually with and sharp skew of performance and standstill cases sometimes , this is due to the lack of stress powers of T-SQL codes which should be considered largely for critical mission DBs in particular more therefore I am going to talk to you about How to capture expensive queries using different techniques ..?and How to optimize them in the shortest time using scientific ways ..? (10 different T-SQL Practices will be explained within this session)

## Title: Build your first notebook using Azure Notebooks
 
**Abstract**:
Sharing and documenting Machine Learning solutions is now easier with Azure Notebooks. Azure Notebooks will allow Data Scientists to share the whole machine learning process from data acquisition, to data cleaning, and finally creating a machine learning model.
With Azure Notebooks the information can also be presented to non-technical stakeholders in an easier way. In this session you will learn 
•	What are Azure Notebooks?
•	How to create your first notebook in Azure Notebooks?
•	How to use code snippets and visualisations in a notebook?
•	Create a slideshow of your notebook
•	How to share your notebook with your team?
By the end of the session you will get a good understanding about Azure Notebooks and how to use them for real world problems.

## Title: Introduction to Azure Analysis Services
 
**Abstract**:
They say every cloud has a silver lining, well this one is gold! This demo heavy session will introduce you to Azure Analysis Services. We begin by looking at a traditional analytics platform, and how this fits into the "modern data warehouse". This session will guide you through the processes (and pitfalls) of modernizing your data analytics solution. Still using PowerPivot models or for that matter still using SQL Server Analysis Services on-premise? Let's see how to leverage these assets into the modern would of cloud computing using Azure Analysis Services, with minimal downtime. Prepare to be amazed at what is possible with all the wonders of cloud computing in the Azure world.

## Title: Automate your Machine Learning
 
**Abstract**:
A typical machine learning experiment involves the following phases - data preparation, algorithm selection, model training, model testing and hyperparameter tuning. The process is usually repeated for a range of machine learning algorithms and then the most optimum model is selected for scoring. This model needs to be exposed to client applications – in SQL Server the model can stored in a table and then wrapped in a stored procedure, while models built using machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn can be exposed through REST APIs.

The machine learning lifecycle is iterative and often time-consuming. What if there was a way to automate some of the processes involved so that the outcome could be generated sooner? In this session, you will see Automated Machine Learning in Microsoft Azure in action. You’ll get to learn key concepts and takeaway enough knowledge to be able to run simple machine learning experiments.

## Title: Secure multiparty Machine Learning with SQL Server Always Encrypted with Secure Enclaves
 
**Abstract**:
Preserving privacy when processing data from multiple sources with machine learning is always a 
challenge. Organizations want to perform collaborative data analytics while guaranteeing the privacy of their individual datasets. Combining multiple data sources to support a better outcome improves accuracy of prediction, but it may come at cost of confidentiality, if sensitive information is not accurately protected.
SQL Server 2019 adds new data security capabilities with Always Encrypted with Secure Enclaves. By using trusted execution environments (TEEs) to protect your data while in use, you can use machine learning algorithms across different organizations to better train models, without revealing the processed data.
In this session, Stefano Tempesta, Microsoft Regional Director and MVP on AI and Business Application, will present the benefits of Confidential Computing in an ML scenario, where separate health institutes collaborate on data analysis and prediction using Azure ML.

## Title: Get Comfortable with Query tuning and Execution Plans
 
**Abstract**:
Even as many of the traditional DBA activities become automated or managed by Cloud providers, the ability to tune and optimize database query performance remains a desirable and marketable skill.

Central to ability to tune queries is an ability to use information provided from Execution plans, DMVs, Query Store and Extended Events.

In this demo based session we will look into:
- What information is available 
- How it can be used.
- Techniques to improve performance. 

Attendees will leave with an understanding of possibilities of turning queries and a roadmap for further learning.

This session will assume a basic knowledge of T-SQL and execution plans.

## Title: Technologies to Watch: A Gaze into Greg's Crystal Ball
 
**Abstract**:
Last year, Greg delivered a session on technologies that fascinate a technologist as the keynote for SQLSaturday Auckland. People were raving about it afterwards and wanted to see a longer version of it. This is a longer and updated version of that keynote. Greg dives into technologies that fascinate him, that he thinks will fascinate you, and that he thinks will fundamentally alter the world. He looks into how they are likely to change work as we know it today. Come and be intrigued and inspired.

## Title: Demystifying Encryption
 
**Abstract**:
With the release of the GDPR regulations and similar global standards security is finally becoming the focus it always should have been.  Businesses are now able to put a number on how much a data breach will cost them...and that number is big enough to put many firms out of business.  
  In this session we'll talk about the various ways you can implement Encryptian natively within SQL Server - with Backup Encryption, Transparent Data Encryption(TDE), AlwaysEncrypted, and connection encryption

## Title: SQL Server Upgrades and Migrations - The Right Way
 
**Abstract**:
There has been lots of focus recently on upgrades and migrations with the end-of-life of SQL Server 2008 and 2008R2.

With so many critical databases running on these older versions, how do you ensure that you achieve a successful and safe transition to your new platform? Fortunately there are some fantastic tools and defined processes that can lead you through each stage. 

There are tools to test different versions and infrastructures, processes to track query regressions and provide a way to remediate them.

This session will walk through the upgrade process from end-to-end and show what tools can help you at each step.

## Title: Azure SQL Database Edge - Tiny but mighty
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever thought what would it be like to run SQL Server engine in a small footprint? Well, wait no more. 
Running on Arm and x64 architecture with a reduced footprint, the proven performant and most secure Microsoft SQL engine is coming to the Edge in interactive devices and edge gateways. Combining new capabilities on data streaming and time-series, with in-database machine learning (ML) and graph, Azure SQL Database Edge is optimized for low-latency analytics right on the Edge. This session will showcase the scenarios Azure SQL Database Edge can enable.

Rolf has 20+ years IT experience and has been working with the SQL platform since v6.0 (that’s 1994!) and has done just about everything you can around SQL related data and data platforms / architectures ever since then.  I have a personal interest in All Things Cloud and Data (Azure, Streaming Data / IoT, Data Warehousing, Machine Learning, Visualisation and SQL Spatial).  I have had the opportunity to present at PASS, TechEd, PASS SQLSaturday, PASS Virtual Chapter, SQL User Groups, Big Data Seminars, Microsoft Technology Roadshows, Breakfast Seminars, ++ and enjoy sharing and learning new ideas.
