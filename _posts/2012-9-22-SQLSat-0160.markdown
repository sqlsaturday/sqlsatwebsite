## Title: Dive into the Query Optimizer-Undocumented Insight
 
**Abstract**:
This 400 (or maybe 500) level session will focus on using undocumented statements and trace flags to get insight into how the query optimizer works and show you which operations it performs during query optimization. I will use these undocumented features to explain what the query optimizer does from the moment a query is submitted to SQL Server until an execution plan is generated including operations like parsing, binding, simplification, trivial plan, and full optimization. Concepts like transformation rules, the memo structure, how the query optimizer generates possible alternative execution plans, and how the best alternative is chosen based on those costs will be explained as well.

## Title: Introduction to SSIS with a Real-World Example
 
**Abstract**:
SSIS is a powerful and east to use data Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) tool SSIS providing a rich set of components to perform the most common ETL tasks with “drag-and-drop” ease. Packages can be constructed with rigorous error and exception handling as well as verbose logging allowing deployment of robust ETL processes.. This session will demonstrate a process for loading a comma-delimited data file into a staging table for further processing then validating the data and moving specific data into host tables using a a thorough example of a non-trivial ETL project with “real” data. The intended audience includes beginning SSIS developers, DBAs, and anyone with a desire to experience the magic of data management with this remarkable tool.

## Title: Hierarchies... on Steroids the No RBAR Way
 
**Abstract**:
Hierarchical data sets are everywhere. If you haven't worked with one yet, you will. If you're already working with them, you know they can be horribly complex, slow performing, difficult to maintain resource hogs that can really take the steam out of any GUI or batch process. This simple but code intensive "black arts" session shows you how to quickly and easily get around all of that using all 3 common hierarchical structures and a new structure that just might make Nested Sets obsolete. For stalwarts, it also includes a very high performance method (100,000 nodes in 6 seconds) for converting Adjacency Lists to Nested Sets that even a beginner can understand.  You just have to know that a Tally Table is involved somewhere in this. ;-)

## Title: Wish you could live the glamorous consulting life?
 
**Abstract**:
Consulting is a great career choice, from the increased pay, (sometimes less), to the flexible hours, (working nights and weekends), you will work with a wide range of customers, (if you can find them), that will lead you to wonder why you didn't start earlier? (and walk away from a cushy job).

I would not trade my consulting career for any other choice, I love the rewards and the freedom it provides me, but I've learned the hard way.
In this session you will lean sales, marketing and management strategies to get your practice off the ground, sand traps to avoid along the way and a honest, down to earth assessment of the consulting life. An essential session for those thinking about this choice and/or those who are just starting out

## Title: Anatomy of a Join
 
**Abstract**:
A lot of database professionals today  do not have a Computer-Science Degree  so they never attended a  “Introduction to Databases” course. In this session we are trying to fix at least one thing and we’ll look in depth at the three types of join operations, visualize how their algorithms work in order to understand how query plans are computed, explain why these join operations have very different performance characteristics and why the optimizer chooses a specific  join operator to use in a query plan. Will demonstrate that empirical cost calculations are similar to what Query Optimizer actually outputs. Good understanding of join algorithms is vital in order to diagnose and remedy issues related to bad query plans.

## Title: Performance Enhancing Laziness
 
**Abstract**:
Walk-up work. New database requests. Users running ad-hoc queries with 18 LEFT OUTER JOINS against heaps.Surprise SQL instances created by vendors without our knowledge crashing around us!It's enough to drive a lesser DBA crazy-insane.  That's why it's important to take as many steps as you can to simplify, automate, tweak, and tune the tasks you can manage so you have time to deal with those situations you can't control.  In this session Tim will go over many of performance-enhancing methods he's developed over the last dozen years as a DBA for a major healthcare concern and show you how you can give yourself some breathing room to make the difficult seem easy.

## Title: DB2: Let's Talk Internals
 
**Abstract**:
Performance tuning is both an art and a science. The more science you bring to your efforts, the better your art will be.
There are many tools and techniques for finding performance problems, but solving them is usually left to the person using those techniques. This extended session focuses on what’s going on under SQL Server’s hood for a set of tasks normally hidden from users, such as: memory allocation, data manipulation, and on-disk and in-memory data structures. Armed with this knowledge, you will be better prepared to solve a variety of performance problems through deeper insight into the processes working behind the scenes.

## Title: Discovering the Plan Cache
 
**Abstract**:
Execution plans are stored after execution in the plan cache. This metadata about how queries are executed can provide insight into how your SQL Server environment is functioning. By using XQuery to browse and search the plan cache you can find potential performance issues and opportunities to tune your queries. This information can be used to help reduce issues related to parallelism, shift queries from using scans to using seek operations, or discover exactly which queries are using what indexes. All of this and more is readily available through the plan cache. In this session we will explore the plan cache and start you on the road to discovery.

## Title: Profiler? What is this tool you speak of?
 
**Abstract**:
Many new DBA's are unaware of the power of SQL Profiler.  Many don't know it exists.  And better yet, it's FREE.  This session will generalize the importance of using Profiler to troubleshoot and tune your SQL queries.  By demonstrating Profiler on a running server, attendees will get a look at what SQL is currently executing.  This session will show how to discover query duration, reads, writes, locks, deadlocks, stored procedure executions and more.
