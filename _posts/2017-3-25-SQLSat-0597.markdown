## Title: How to troubleshoot beyond what you understand
 
**Abstract**:
Troubleshooting can be easy when the cause of an issue is obvious - except sometimes it isn't because it's not. In those cases, how do you find the cause - especially when it's something you don't directly control? You're having issues with your storage, but is it a result of RAID being setting up improperly or a constraint on the fiber channel switch? Can you tell the difference between a blockage of firewall ports and a network switch that's nearing capacity? You're not a SAN admin or a firewall engineer, but you don't need to be to understand enough to identify whether these systems are involved.

In this session, we'll talk about troubleshooting as a process - how you can identify issues beyond what you can see and may not understand. While we may discuss some specific situations or hard-to-identify causes in the examples, the session will be focused on understanding the impact of different issues, and how you can better identify the cause of an issue when it's outside your system.

## Title: Are you down with MPP? - Part 1 - Hadoop Based Solutions
 
**Abstract**:
Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) architectures allow the use of large numbers of processors (or computers) to perform a set of coordinated computations simultaneously.  MPP architectures can help with the processing and aggregation of large volumes of data with varying shapes, but can be complicated and costly to deploy and maintain.  We'll explore using the Microsoft Azure cloud as a platform for quickly creating cost-effective MPP solutions.  We will use Microsoft Azure to deploy and process data with a Hadoop based MMP architecture (using HDInsight).  The pros and cons of Hadoop based MPP, as well as when a company might choose a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering over an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) solution.  This talk will be packed full of demos and real-world learnings.

## Title: A Masters Passport to Extended Events
 
**Abstract**:
"As is commonly the case, all good things come to an end.  And now is as good a time as any for the use of SQL Trace and Profiler to come to an end.  Let’s face it, Trace was a good tool and had some wonderful uses.  Profiler for that matter was a good tool and was useful at times.
It is time to let those old tools retire gracefully and move into the world of XE.  This full day workshop will provide you the means to let Profiler and Trace be retired from your toolset as you discover all that XE has to offer.

This full day session on Extended Events will help prepare you to put this tool to immediate use as you walk back to your daily duties.  This workshop will teach you about Extended Events starting with the basics and moving through how to create XE sessions that will get the right data for you, while doing so with minimal impact.

You will be exposed to advanced troubleshooting techniques as we work through complex issues that are made easier through the use of XE.  Take advantage

## Title: The Anatomy of Select
 
**Abstract**:
TSQL is one of the most valuable tools any SQL Server professional can add to their tool-set. More aptly, TSQL is a whole chest of tools for the SQL Server professional. One of the most important tools in that TSQL chest is a good understanding of the SELECT statement.

When was the last time you sat down to evaluate a SELECT statement? What actually goes into the processing of that teeny little word? There might be a fair bit more to this simple term than just fetching data from the database. This session covers the simplicity of the select. Then we take it a step further to dive into some of the complexities tied directly to this particular statement.

This session will help the attendee better understand the Select statement. With a more solid understanding of this statement, the attendee can return and implement some of this new knowledge to help improve processing and query response times in their own environments.

## Title: Query Optimization Statistics : Driving Force Behind Performance
 
**Abstract**:
When the SQL Server optimizer evaluates a query to determine how best to execute it, the statistics are quite possibly the most important tool at its disposal. But SQL Server statistics objects aren’t perfect because they only contain summary information. In this session, we’ll start with an overview of what the statistics objects are, how the optimizer uses them, and some general guidelines for their maintenance. Then we’ll look at some of the issues – and solutions –  that can arise due to their imperfection: ascending keys, correlated predicates, skewed distribution, or downright bad summary information.

## Title: PowerBI, from a DBA
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft’s PowerBI is the new hotness. In this session, you will get your hands dirty and dive into PowerBI and create an actual report, with actual data. You will get to learn from examples from what a DBA has done to implement PowerBI in his shop and make his data accessible.

As a DBA, we often need to collect and display data in a friendly and interactive fashion. We will play with some PowerShell to collect data from several systems, store this data in an Azure DB in the Cloud, then point PowerBI at this data to display and interact with said data. You will learn a little about PowerShell, Azure SQL DB, PowerBI, and how to make these work for you.

You will be given permissions to an Azure DB, and get connected to this source. You will also need to have PowerBI desktop downloaded and installed. We will be using this to create the report during the session. So please come prepared to interact with the internet, with a cloud-based database you will be provided, and PowerBI Desk

## Title: I/O Tuning 101
 
**Abstract**:
One of the most common problems I have encountered as a DBA is the complaints from users that a particular query is slow, just one query.  Many times one that used to run in acceptable time, but that over time has slowed down substantially.

In this session we will show some of the causes for this, with emphasis on I/O requests being too high for the query.  

First part of the session will explain how to find these numbers, looking at a few queries with some major performance issues, including explaining why they have a problem.

The second part will focus on how to reduce I/O requests.

All of this can be done without the need for any 3rd party tools, all within the scope of what is available to SQL Server, all versions, all editions, including Azure.

## Title: Faster Provisioning with SQL Clone
 
**Abstract**:
Database provisioning requests are the bane of many DBA’s working lives. Developers want to work with realistic data, DBAs want to protect Production and secure data.
 
But copying databases for development and test is a job that gets 'delegated up'; DBAs, IT Managers, those with the keys to Production find themselves performing the task, and the development team is often blocked while it takes place.
 
The same people are often responsible for ensuring the copy is appropriate for the environment (permissions, configuration data, sensitive data), so have to perform semi-manual tasks and maintain brittle scripts to do so.
 
In this session Redgate’s Grant Fritchey shows how new tool SQL Clone enables self-service or easy automation of database copies and is near-instant at the time of need, using a fraction of the disk space, and allowing quick reversion to a baseline or snapshotting of changes.

## Title: Deep Dive into the SSIS Catalog
 
**Abstract**:
The SSIS catalog is one of the best-evolved features in the SQL Server Integration Services ecosystem. With integrated package storage, Windows ACL-like security settings, built-in logging, and many other features, the SSIS catalog has become an anchor for many ETL architectures. With all this complexity, it is important to understand the inner workings of the SSIS catalog to keep it running smoothly.

In this demo-heavy presentation, we will dive into the details of the SSIS catalog. We will start with a quick survey of catalog features, followed by an exploration of the moving parts (tables, views, and stored procedures) in the catalog database. We will also review the security capabilities in the catalog, and will discuss maintenance operations. Finally, we'll walk through the mechanics of deployment and execution, reviewing what happens under the covers during these operations.

## Title: Pick the right R - R, Microsoft R Open and Microsoft R Server
 
**Abstract**:
After Microsoft acquired Revolution Analytics, it has released Microsoft R Open (MRO, formerly Revolution R Open) and Microsoft R Server (MRS,   formerly Revolution R Enterprise). While there is publicly available information on these, analytics community is still getting familiar with these. During the presentation, Divya will address these three questions – 
•	What do R, MRO, and MRS have in common?
•	What’s new in MRO and MRS compared with R?
•	Why should I use MRO or MRS instead of R?
In addition to this, she will also give a demo of how to get started with Microsoft R Open and Microsoft R Server. She will also demonstrate how to deploy an end to end application using SQL Server R Services and Power BI.

## Title: Indexing for Beginners
 
**Abstract**:
To a beginner, indexes may seem like magic. The right index can drastically reduce query time. But, how do you know which indexes are the right ones? SQL Server will suggest helpful indexes in the graphical execution plan and with the Database Engine Tuning Advisor, but follow that advice with caution. This session will explain how indexes work and how to tune indexes so that your application has the best performance.

## Title: Sentiment Analysis with R
 
**Abstract**:
Companies today are using sentiment analysis to improve customer experience by understanding the attitude of their customers based on tweets, facebook posts, and other social networking outlets. The ability to perceive a customer’s feelings benefits that company by advising them on what changes they can make to improve their customer’s experiences. A great way to do this is in open-source tools such as R. In R, we can classify the polarity as well as the emotion behind a comment from Twitter feeds. Rachael will show the basics of using a few R functions to do this, with visualizations as well.

## Title: SQL lessons learned operating at scale
 
**Abstract**:
When your SQL Server environment runs 24*7 and is *very sensitive* to interruptions, how one performs basic maintenance activities, supports development and deployment, and ensures proper backups requires a different mindeset for performing these tasks.
Everything from how you implement SQL Server to how a table is designed requires a different thought process when the daily "overnight" or weekly "downtime" windows do not exist.  
Everything you do happens alongside and impacts user-facing activity.
In this session I will present various high-level lessons learned along the path of user happiness in an always-in-use environment.

## Title: Azure SQL Database for the DBA
 
**Abstract**:
Everyone knows that Azure SQL Database only supports a small subset of SQL Server functionality, small databases, and has really bad performance. Except, everyone is wrong. In fact, Azure SQL Server Database is ready to support many, if not most, databases within your enterprise. This session reintroduces Azure SQL Database and shows the high degree of functionality and improved performance that is now available. We'll cover topics from monitoring, to high availability to disaster recovery, all within Azure SQL Database. You’ll leave this session with a more thorough understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of Azure SQL Database so that you can make a more informed choice over when, or if, you should use it within your environment.

## Title: Change Data Capture, maybe you should consider it again.
 
**Abstract**:
Change Data Capture (CDC) was released with SQL Server 2008 and has been enhanced in several subsequent releases of SQL Server. Sever Stored Procedures were first provided to aid in using CDC with ETL and/or other CDC related processes. SQL Server 2012 included the release of the CDC Source and several other SSIS Task that greatly simplified the process of using CDC in your ETL. In this session, I want to share some of the creative uses I have seen involving CDC and hear about some of the things you have seen and or done with it.

## Title: It’s Time for a Change: Temporal Table Support in SQL Server 2016
 
**Abstract**:
Without temporal tables (AKA history tables), we can only see the current version of data. We can’t see rows that have been deleted or rows as they existed before the latest update. The temporal table support in SQL Server 2016 gives us the ability to create system maintained “history” tables to track all changes to the table data.

In this session we’ll discuss how you can benefit from temporal support in your tables, how to implement temporal tables in SQL Server 2016, and how to write “time travel queries” using the new FOR SYSTEM_TIME clause in a SELECT statement to easily query historical information.

## Title: Change Detection in SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Change detection is a critical component of any system that moves data from one structure to another. Most data movement mechanisms are designed to move a subset of the data – only that which is new or changed since the last load. For that to work properly, there must be a reliable system for detecting delta data touched since the most recent load. 

In this session, we will review the tools and design patterns available in SQL Server for performing change detection. From source detection methods including change tracking and change data capture, to in-flight comparisons using hashed values, and even brute-force methods as a last resort, we’ll cover the spectrum of change detection tools in SQL Server.

## Title: Tableau and Power BI-Compare and Contrast
 
**Abstract**:
The goal of self-service BI is to give users the means to interact and understand their data quickly. There are a plethora of tools in the Market. For many years Tableau was the undisputed leader in this rapidly evolving space. Post 2015 a new tool from Microsoft emerged – Power BI. It was and is still considered a disruptor in the Data visualization space.

Faced with a tool that has been in the market for over 10 years and a rapidly evolving product that has the backing of a Software giant from Redmond , how does an individual or an organization go about choosing the right product. Let’s dive deeper. In this demonstration rich session we’ll look at how the tools compare against different functional scenarios.

We’ll see how each tool can handle-

-	Represent Data using Maps
-	Drill downs and Hierarchies
-	Trending and Forecasting 
-	Grouping and Organizing data
-	Combing data from different sources and source type
-       Community support
And much more..!

## Title: Turbo Boost Performance: In Memory Tables index optimizations
 
**Abstract**:
With the introduction of in-memory based tables in SQL Server 2014, it’s natural to expect  significant increases in query performance. But what do we do when queries which utilize in-memory tables actually start to perform same or, in some cases, even worse than their equivalent disk based table predecessors?  In this session, we are going to take a look at the changes to the indexing design for in-memory based objects and how it differs from existing disk based table indexing.

## Title: DBA 101 – Let’s Get Started
 
**Abstract**:
We've all installed SQL Server and, most of the times, the default settings work just fine.  This is a beginner session that will help you to understand what those settings mean along with why there might be times that you want to use something other than the defaults and how that might impact your server.  We'll also go through unattended installs, both with and without a config file.  This can really help to standardize your SQL Server installations and save you some precious keystrokes.

## Title: Logical Data Warehousing with Tableau 10
 
**Abstract**:
Abstract - Logical Data Warehousing with Tableau 10

Logical Data Warehousing has become a trending BI topic. The purpose of an LDW is to extend a traditional Data Warehouse with supplemental information, and is even being used to reduce development time by supplanting  the traditional data warehouse altogether.

Many tools are now available that will help in the creation of an LDW. The latest version of Tableau provides tools for combining data from disparate sources into a unified data source that is consumable by end users.

Learn about LDW, and learn how Tableau 10 can help provide value to your client in less time than with a classic data warehouse solution.
