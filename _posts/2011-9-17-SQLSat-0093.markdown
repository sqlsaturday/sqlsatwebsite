## Title: Architecting Microsoft SQL Server Availability in 
 
**Abstract**:
The addition of virtualization support has changed the way architects and DBAs need to look at availability in the SQL Server world. How does Hyper-V Live Migration or vMWare's vMotion work in conjunction with existing SQL Server availability technologies like log shipping, database mirroring, or replication? As you architect your SQL Server infrastructure virtually, what do you need to know to ensure that you help provide the best solution using available technologies? Through demonstration using a scenario-based approach, learn when and how to use virtualization availability features and Windows Failover Clustering in combination with SQL Server technologies and the impact of combining them. See how Live Migration does not cover you in al
