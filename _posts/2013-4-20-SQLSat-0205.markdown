## Title: Tasting the Analysis Services 2012 Flavors
 
**Abstract**:
The Unified Dimensional Modeling (UDM) concept was introduced in Analysis Services 2005 as the semantic layer to enable the OLAP cube development from multiple sources using an abstract layer. Analysis Services 2012 introduces the Business Intelligence Semantic Model (BISM) concept as an evolution to UDM, offering two new 'flavors': the Multidimensional Mode and the Tabular Mode. The BISM represents the heart of Microsoft Business Intelligence strategy for now and the upcoming years. This session will explain and clarify the basic concepts of Analysis Services 2012 and PowerPivot. We will also discuss different scenarios that will allow BI architects / developers take better decisions when building up the foundation for their companies’ Enterprise Analytics strategy.

## Title: Predictive Analytics using SQL Analysis Services 2012
 
**Abstract**:
El análisis predictivo es el área dentro de Inteligencia de Negocios que busca dar conocimiento más allá de lo que ya sucedió en el pasado de su empresa o data, o incluso de lo que está pasando ahora mismo. El análisis predictivo, busca proyección en el próximo paso para influir o tener más información de lo que podrá ocurrir en el futuro cercano basado en técnicas avanzadas de minería de datos, ya sea proyectar un valor futuro para nuestras ventas en una sucursal  (forecasting) o saber cuál debe ser el próximo producto que nuestro cliente estaría interesado en poner en su carrito de compras como lo hace Amazon.com. Acompáñenme durante esta sesión para contarles cómo Analysis Services nos puede ayudar (a nosotros comunes mortales de SQL), a crear ventajas competitivas para tu empresa.

## Title: DW Design Tips Slowly Changing Dimensions
 
**Abstract**:
In the session we are going to take on a challenging subject that all designers face: how to deal with changing dimensions. Unlike most OLTP systems, a major objective of a data warehouse is to track history. So, accounting for change is one of the analyst’s most important responsibilities. Ralph Kimball introduced the concept of slowly changing dimension (SCD) attributes in 1996. Dimensional modelers, in conjunction with the business’s data governance representatives, must specify the data warehouse’s response to operational attribute value changes.  In this session we will also explain “type numbers” assigned to several techniques that have been described in the past.

## Title: MS Access with SQL Server Strategies and Tips
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server DBA's face a lot of challenges now days, from maintaining servers to putting out fires. One of them is how to properly deal with Access databases in the workplace. Quite frequently they contain mission critical data and grown to be important to your business. Upsizing them to SQL Server is just the first step, you need to change Access's forms, reports, queries and code to avoid issues with your server. In this session we will discuss strategies; from importing data to optimizing the relationship between Access and SQL. Users will leave having a much better understanding of how to incorporate Access in the workplace and safeguard their data.

## Title: Stay ahead with Change Data Capture
 
**Abstract**:
This is the era of data. The Business is demanding up to day information and insight in a timelier manner. We need a solution that could enable us to satisfy those needs and be as close as real time. This session will provide insight on how to use the Change Data Capture (CDC) inside SQL Server to load your Fact and Dimension tables that will accommodate those business needs. After this session you will be able to implement the concepts in your on environments to achieve the reporting and data requirements.

## Title: SQL Server Deployment Options
 
**Abstract**:
Today companies are looking for options related to the deployment of their database workloads. Some database servers may need to be installed on-premise because of regulatory or performance reasons. For other scenarios, it may make more sense to deploy these databases in virtual-machines hosted in the cloud. Finally, newer applications may be better suited for Platform as a Service (PaaS) architectures.

Indistinctively of which deployment model makes sense for you, it is extremely important to have a consistent user experience when managing, monitoring and developing for these databases. Learn about how you start today to take advantage of SQL Server deployment options.

## Title: Getting Started with MDX: The (Very) Basics
 
**Abstract**:
In this session, led by Microsoft BI Architect, SQL Server MVP, and Analysis Services Maestro Bill Pearson, we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.

## Title: TempDB Performance Troubleshooting and Optimizing
 
**Abstract**:
Every SQL Server instance relies on the tempdb database. Whether through explicit use with #temp tables or @table variables, or implicit use through working space for many other operations, most tempdb databases get quite a workout. This session will dig into many of the otherwise-hidden issues that can kill server performance. Attend this session and you will be able to spot tempdb performance issues, drill into the causes, and take the steps necessary to solve them.

## Title: Serene Velocity: Reporting Services and SSAS Data
 
**Abstract**:
SSRS 2008 and above provides powerful capabilities to help us develop sophisticated reports from Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services. Unfortunately, many features, such as server aggregation, are commonly ignored by report developers. The result: redundant work in the reporting layer. In this session, BI Architect, SQL Server MVP and Analysis Services Maestro Bill Pearson exposes ways to optimize reporting from SSAS by writing MDX that leverages, rather than replicates, what the cube is designed to do best.

## Title: Partitioning for Perf and Mgmt of Large Tables
 
**Abstract**:
Managing data in ever-growing transaction and history tables can be challenging. Activities with large chunks of data such as moving data to archive tables, batch-importing many rows, or defragging an entire table when only the active portion changes introduces heavy I/O and blocking. Table partitioning solves a host of headaches with minimal effort. Ever wanted to truncate or defrag part of a table, or insert an entire staging table of data into another table in milliseconds instead of hours?  Come see what partitioning can provide for you.
