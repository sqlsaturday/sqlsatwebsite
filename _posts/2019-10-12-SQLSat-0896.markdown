## Title: Active Directory and Azure Active Directory: Authentication in a Cloudy World
 
**Abstract**:
If you're planning on deploying Office 365 or Azure, whether you know it or not, you will be using Azure Active Directory (AAD). But, you've already got on-prem Active Directory. How do these two products work together? Are they the same thing? SHOULD they work together? In this session I'll answer these questions, compare and contrast AD and AAD usage in Azure and hybrid scenarios, discuss costs, and some best practices.
This is a beginner session, but there will be some networking involved, in addition to "legacy" AD functionality and settings.
