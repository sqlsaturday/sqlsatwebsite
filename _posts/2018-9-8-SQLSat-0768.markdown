## Title: How to Perform a Health Check
 
**Abstract**:
Are you uncertain about the health and capacity of your SQL Server? Are you taking over a new server and need to get a better understanding of the health of the server? Are you uncertain if your servers are following industry best practices?

In this session we will start by discussing the importance of performing a Health Check. We will then show how to run the popular Blitz script by Brent Ozar. After that we will review the other key areas to check like the VM configuration, Windows Configuration, SQL Configuration, Security configuration, and Database configuration. Finally, we’ll show how to save the results for capacity and trending analysis

At the end of the session you will be able to: (1) Perform a Health Check on a server; (2) List the key areas for improvement; (3) Save the results for capacity and trending analysis.

## Title: Data Vault 2.0 An Agile BI DB Design Method
 
**Abstract**:
Dan Linstedt, the creator of Data Vault 2.0, describes it as follows: The Data Vault Model is a detail oriented, historical tracking and uniquely linked set of normalized tables that support one or more functional areas of business. It is a hybrid approach encompassing the best of breed between 3rd normal form (3NF) and star schema. The design is flexible, scalable, consistent and adaptable to the needs of the enterprise. Data Vault 2.0 is not an app but a database modeling methodology that overcomes many of the shortcomings of DW modeling. Data vault attempts to solve the problem of dealing with change in the environment by separating the business keys from the descriptive attributes of those keys. This presentation will go over the basic parts of the Data Vault 2.0 model along with examples of each.

## Title: The Ultimate Maintenance Plan
 
**Abstract**:
Is your SQL Server running slower and slower? Do you prefer a proactive rather than a reactive approach to managing SQL Server? Do you worry about being able to recover in an emergency? If you answer yes to any of the above this session is for you. 

We will start by exploring some of the maintenance options that are available. We will then explore the popular utility program by Ola Hallengren and how to implement. Next, we will explore the other areas of SQL Server that need to be maintained like history tables in MSDB. Finally, we will explore the different options when maintenance windows are tight. 

At the end of this session you will be able to: (1) Choose a maintenance program for your SQL Servers; (2) Program and schedule the maintenance programs; (3) Ensure that the SQL Server is running at optimum performance each day.

## Title: Locking and its effects on queries and maintenance tasks
 
**Abstract**:
Multi-user systems are affected by how SQL Server locks resources to manage concurrent transactions. Understanding how SQL Server uses locks to isolate transactions from one another is important for both writing code and running maintenance tasks. 

In this session, we will discuss lock modes in SQL Server and how they impact your queries. We will show how different isolation levels change which locks are taken and for how long they are held. We will look at ways to avoid unnecessary blocking for maintenance tasks like index rebuilds. Assertions will be backed up with demo-based evidence.

After this session, you will have the understanding you need to start writing application code and maintenance jobs suitable for concurrent systems by anticipating blocking issues due to locking.

## Title: Recent SSMS Performance Tuning Enhancements
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Management Studio has for some time been undergoing very rapid changes and improvements!  Many of the improvements are focused on helping improve SSMS's ability to help with performance tuning problems.  The SQL Server engine itself has had many such improvements too.  Join me for a demo-filled run down of some of the highlights of these changes!

## Title: Columnstore 101: The Five Ws of Columnstore Indexes
 
**Abstract**:
Even though Columnstore Indexes were introduced with SQL Server 2012, their popularity and general use haven't increased nearly as much as their functionality since then.  If you're someone that's not had much experience with Columnstore Indexes and want to learn more about them, this session is perfect for you as I plan to cover the Five Ws of Columnstore Indexes: what they are, when to use them, where they are best utilized, and most importantly why they work so well.  You'll be the "who" and after the session, I expect you'll feel more confident and excited to use this great feature.

## Title: Laying Down the Law with SQL Server Resource Governor
 
**Abstract**:
Mixed workload patterns can present resource utilization and performance challenges even on the beefiest database servers. Neither prior testing nor careful code promotion alone can prevent runaway queries from disrupting normal business activities.  In this session we'll stress SQL Server 2017 to explore Resource Governor strategies for managing concurrency and access to resources. We’ll look at the improved observability and troubleshooting ability that Resource Governor brings to a busy database server.  We'll also discuss throttles outside of Resource Governor that can assist in these areas.

## Title: Azure Data Factory V2: The cloud SSIS we have been waiting for?
 
**Abstract**:
Azure Data Factory V2 is currently in preview and has a lot of great new SSIS-like features but is it good enough to replace SSIS? In this session we will go over some of the new control flow, branching, and scheduling features in Azure Data Factory and see how to make a fully cloud capable data orchestration engine. As a bonus we'll also show how you can run SSIS packages directly in Azure!

## Title: Azure Managed Instance: Reducing Maintenance Costs While Making Migration Simple
 
**Abstract**:
While Azure SQL Database provides the full feature of the SQL Server database engine, it is designed primarily for newly developed, cloud-based applications.  For existing applications running on traditional SQL Server instances, the cost and complexity of migration can be prohibitive.  With the release of Azure Managed Instances, much of the cost and complexity have been removed.  Join me for this session to learn about the differences between Azure SQL Database and Azure Managed Instances. Additionally, discover methods for migrating existing instances to Azure.

## Title: Know What Your Code is Doing to SQL Server!
 
**Abstract**:
ORMs - oh how I LOVE them! As a consultant, when I see them in play at a client I go KACHIIINNNNGGGG!! :-D Seriously though, they can provide some substantial benefits for coding throughput. But if you don't Read The Fine Manual and do some things right and avoid some major gotchas you will fall prey to one of my favorite Guruisms: "Anything that allows developers to slap code together more quickly is inversely proportional to the performance, concurrency and scalability you will get from that code"! Although this talk is based on Entity Framework, most ORMs suffer from the same flaws.

## Title: Decoding the Cardinality Estimator to Speed Up Queries
 
**Abstract**:
The cardinality estimator in SQL Server is a massively complex piece of software that is responsible for calculating the estimated number of rows for query plans. We will derive some of the simplest and most important rules for cardinality estimation. Armed with that knowledge, we will address errors in cardinality estimates which can cause poor query performance. Demos include filtering on multiple columns, using local variables, dealing with ascending keys, and more.

## Title: JSON for the Data Mortals
 
**Abstract**:
Do you see curly brackets stored in your database and wonder what that is? Are you a DBA, with developers storing JSON in your database? As a database administrator or developer, it's important to understand JSON today.  This session will explain what JSON is, where it came from, and why it is showing up all over the place.  When you leave this session you will understand how to investigate, manipulate, and validate JSON in your database.  You will walk away with example code of how to use Microsoft’s additions to SQL Server to use this data.
