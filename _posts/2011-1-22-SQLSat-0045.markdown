## Title: SQL Server Encryption - Secure Your Data @ Rest!
 
**Abstract**:
In 2007 the media was buzzing with reports that hackers stole 45.7 million credit card numbers from a major retailer's databases. Experts agree the damage could have been mitigated with database encryption.  In this presentation attendees will learn how to secure their corporate data in SQL Server 2008.  Attendees will explore cell-level encryption, cryptographic hash functions, transparent database encryption (TDE), extensible key management (EKM), and even SQL CLR.  By attending this presentation you will learn techniques that will ensure that your company doesn't appear in the headlines in the headlines for all the wrong reasons. Don't become another statistic; data security is a topic that no database professional can afford to ignore.

## Title: ETL from the Trenches: SSIS in the Real World
 
**Abstract**:
Sure you've read the SSIS books. And sure you've seen a lot of SSIS presentations. But how do you put it all together to create a solid ETL framework for loading your data warehouse environment? In this (updated for 2010) session, we'll look at the ins and outs of a real-world ETL environment built using SSIS. We'll discuss the ETL design patterns used to handle a multi-tiered data warehouse environment with multiple data sources, different loading schedules, and different data transformation requirements. We'll also discuss how the development team responsible for the ETL environment at the Department of Veterans Affairs handles package auditing and logging, team development, package testing, and automated deployments.

## Title: Drive SQL Server Performance: I/O For Developers
 
**Abstract**:
  An often-overlooked aspect to data optimization is what is happens under the covers – how does SQL Server store and access data?  There are plenty of common rules covering tuning, but this session looks at data access from the physical layer, detailing how table access and indexes work, showing why some designs perform poorly, and why adding more indexes may not help.  This will not be a discussion of normal forms or design rules. Instead, it will be a technical session providing the foundation for you to choose which concepts to apply to your designs.
  The session starts with the notion that SQL Server is not a magic box – most of what happens is well-documented and must be taken into consideration when designing or tuning databases.

## Title: Database Design Fundamentals
 
**Abstract**:
In this session I will give an overview of how to design a database, including the common normal forms and why they should matter to you if you are creating or modifying SQL Server databases. Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have proven for many years. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against the way data should be structured and can be avoided by applying the basic normalization techniques and are obvious things that you find yourself struggling with time and again (i.e. using the SUBSTRING function in a WHERE clause meaning you can't use an index efficiently).

## Title: Do It Right: Best Practices for Analysis Services 
 
**Abstract**:
Are you seeking practical, in-depth technical advice for building a BI solution using SSAS? Analysis Services changed tremendously with the advent of SQL Server 2005. It introduced a new way of building dimensions and cubes that required a new way of modeling the solution. This session examines the best practices for properly designing cubes for performance and usability. It discusses some high-level topics but also looks at advanced topics such as alternative approaches to many-to-many dimensions, SCOPE statements, aggregation design, scalability issues, processing techniques, server properties, and more.

## Title: Attribute Discretization in Analysis Services
 
**Abstract**:
Attribute discretization is an oft-overlooked feature in Analysis Services that allows us to automatically create a manageable number of groups of attribute values that are clearly separated by boundaries. Discretization can help us to make it easier for information consumers to work with large numbers of possible attribute member values. In this session, we will discuss the varied options, the design (and other) considerations involved, and best practices surrounding the use of this capability.

## Title: Monitoring Data Changes with Change Data Capture
 
**Abstract**:
Most modern enterprise database environments require some measure of auditing their data. Previously, the DBA would need to put together a complicated web of triggers and history tables in order to properly track data changes. Now in SQL Server 2008, Change Data Capture allows the DBA to readily enact a very straight-forward method for tracking the changes and understanding easily how they took place. In this session, we will examine how to set-up, configure, use, and administer the Change Data Capture process in your environment

## Title: Moving Data with SQL Azure and SSIS
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Azure allows you to host your data in SQL Server in the cloud. That provides some big benefits in scalability and management. However, it leaves open the question, “How do you get your data into / out of the cloud?” At some point, you are going to need to move data to or from an on-premise store to SQL Azure. In this session, we’ll discuss the available options for this, including SSIS, the Sync Framework, and BCP. We’ll cover the pros and cons for each. We’ll drill into one of the options, SSIS, in detail, and review performance options and potential issues that you may encounter when doing this.

## Title: Better Data Visualizations with SSRS
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2008 R2 provides many compelling reasons to upgrade especially in the area of Reporting Services. In this session, we will walk through all of the new data visualizations that are available in the latest release from Microsoft. You will learn how to use Sparklines, Indicators, Data Bars, as well as the integrated Bing Maps control in order for you to create more captivating data visualizations for your BI projects. Along the way we'll also delve into other important new features such as shared datasets, new data sources, and the Report Part Gallery. You'll leave this session with the knowledge you need to take your next BI project to the next level.

## Title: Achieving Separation of Duties with SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server provides a rich set of security features that allow customers to satisfy their security goals. Everything from encrypting sensitive data to recording all activity within a particular database is easily attainable with the features introduced in 2008. While SQL Server does not provide a packaged solution to facilitate Separation of Duties, it does provide functionality that allows Separation of Duties to be achieved. Come to this session to understand how to leverage the functionality available in SQL Server implemented through free community tools and achieve all of your compliance goals.

## Title: Become a Bilingual DBA! Oracle for the SQL Server 
 
**Abstract**:
In today's enterprise environments, it is becoming increasingly necessary to integrate data from a variety of sources. As SQL Server continues its march into the enterprise, the days of focusing 100% on one platform are over. At a bare minimum, we need to be able to communicate with DBA's for other platforms. Terminology as simple as Instance and Database mean very different things in Oracle than they do in SQL Server. In this session, we will compare and contrast the two platforms in terms of features and terminology. We will also discuss some of the best practices and pitfalls when integrating the two.

## Title: PowerPivot: Delivering Self-Serve BI
 
**Abstract**:
If you are always looking for better ways to deliver value to the business as part of a BI project, make sure you examine the capabilities of PowerPivot. Using existing data and tools, users now have the ability to analyze vast quantities of data without first designing dimensions and measure groups. Users can explore the data and optionally share their analysis with others. See how Gemini opens the power of Analysis Services to non-technical users while still allowing the IT organization to administer and secure the data.

## Title: Find Performance Problems by Reading the Waits
 
**Abstract**:
Start with a simple proposition: a process is either working or waiting.  You can tune the working part, but are you seeing the whole picture? There are many different resources on which your process could be waiting – a lock, memory, disk, CPU, and much more.  When a process must wait, SQL Server will log it. There are hundreds of different wait types, and they are a gold mine of data for finding and solving performance problems – and proving the changes worked.  After attending this session, you will be able to gather wait stats and use them to zero in on performance issues affecting your databases.  Stop guessing, start knowing!

## Title: Manage SQL Server System and Performance Data with
 
**Abstract**:
Maintaining a solid set of information about our servers and their performance is critical when issues arise, and often help us see a problem before it occurs.  Buiding a baseline of performance metrics allows us to know when something is wrong and help us to track it down and fix the problem.  This session will walk you through a series of PowerShell scripts you can schedule which will capture the most important data and a set of reports to show you how to use that data to keep your server running smoothly.
