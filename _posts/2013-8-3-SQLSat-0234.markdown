## Title: Get a Lever and Pick Any Turtle: Lifting with Metadata
 
**Abstract**:
Get a Lever and Pick Any Turtle: Lifting with Metadata

Ever wondered how to do operations on a list of tables?  Get a list of all the columns over a certain length?  Automate tedious writing of repetitive code if only there was a way to tell the query to just do this for all VARCHAR columns?

Integrated metadata is a required element of all RDBMSs. In addition to ANSI INFORMATION_SCHEMA and metadata on implementation-specific features like indexes, SQL Server also offers a very powerful extended properties feature. In this talk, I cover using the basic metadata combined with extended properties and demonstrate some practical usages to organize and document a system's design and monitor the health of a system's compliance with design rules, but there are many uses of the system metadata for code generation and automating maintenance.

Basic knowledge of T-SQL and relational database principles is assumed.

## Title: SQL 2012 OLAP vs Tabular Modeling
 
**Abstract**:
The Highway Safety Research Group at Louisiana State University, funded by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (LA DOTD), collects and analyzes traffic crash data for the state of Louisiana.  Over the past few years, a major focus was placed on decreasing the time it takes to report crash data to the state.  With the success of data collection efforts, the HSRG is now focusing on providing tools and resources to help agencies at all levels throughout the state better understand and utilize their crash data.  

In 2011, the HSRG developed an OLAP cube for 'slicing and dicing' crash, DWI, and Roadway data to improve traffic safety. In 2013, the HSRG, utilizing the same data warehouse, built a very similar tool utilizing the new BISM Tabular Model in SQL 2012.  This session will show the two models, discuss advantages  disadvantages of each model, and present data reporting options (Reporting Services, Tableau, and Power View).

## Title: Configuring SharePoint Search for an optimal document management experience
 
**Abstract**:
Search in SharePoint 2013 has many new features to deliver an excellent document management experience.  In this talk, we'll learn how to take advantage of the hard work you have invested in classifying your documents with rich metadata.  Administrators will learn step-by-step how to map crawled properties to managed properties allowing you to query and refine on the data in your site columns.  We'll look in depth at managed property options such as queryable, retrievable, and refinable.  Once we demonstrate the intricacies of property mapping, attendees will learn how to take advantage of them in the Search Center.  We'll create custom result types to display custom data from site columns and we'll configure the refinement panel to allow users to drill down results in ways never before possible.   Finally, we'll show you how to use entity extraction to infer values of metadata allowing you to do refinement.

## Title: Power of Patterns: Refactoring to (or away from) Patterns
 
**Abstract**:
What is a design pattern? Why should you care? What it the power of design patterns? How do design patterns tie into object oriented programming? If I'm using objects in my code, isn't that object oriented programming? (The answer is not necessarily!) When should I use them?

Design Patterns are great but the temptation is to use Design Patterns as a golden hammer. This can lead to unnecessarily complicated, over-engineered code in an effort to be flexible and ready for the future. That sounds reasonable - if you happen to be a psychic. More commonly, you will refactor to a pattern when the code (that you’ve written simply and minimally) demands it.

We'll talk about why you should know common design patterns, why they are powerful, how they relate to object oriented principles, different composite refactorings that will move you to (and sometimes away) from patterns and the smells that help you know when to apply them.

## Title: Windows Azure IaaS and You
 
**Abstract**:
Cloud computing is emerging as a promising IT service delivery vehicle. But is the question “To cloud or not to cloud”? For IT professionals and your IT organizations, it is crucial to recognize the opportunities and play a key role in the transformation from existing infrastructure-focused IT into a service-oriented, user-centric, and IT-as-a-Service (IaaS) environment. Are you ready for the challenge to lead and transform your IT organization?

This session will clarify the myths and provide pertinent information on cloud computing from a business and IT professional’s viewpoint. We will review the architectures and examine the service delivery models of cloud computing while stepping through business scenarios and operations of employing public cloud and private cloud.

## Title: Analytics 101 : Big data, business intelligence, and predictive analytics for decision makers
 
**Abstract**:
Business analytics is the hottest ticket in the IT world these days.  The trouble is, the industry doesn’t seem to agree on what “it” might be.  Is analytics jazzed up reporting and slick dashboards?  Is it statistical modeling?  Is it Hadoop?  Is it SAS?  Is it PowerView? What’s a poor technical manager to do when the C-Suite demands it?
Business analytics is the art and science of data driven decision making.  Analytics projects span corporate performance management, reporting, dashboarding, statistical analysis, predictive modeling, a/b experimentation, and a host of other techniques all designed to help organizations make fact based decisions using business data.  
Rusty Frioux from DataClear will sort out truth from hype and give some practical guidance for anyone tasked with starting an analytics initiative.

## Title: Unit Tests in Action – an exercise in updating legacy code, and how unit tests play a critical role
 
**Abstract**:
This session will attempt to show how to use unit tests to confidently make changes to existing production code, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.  It will do so in a “hands on presentation” sort of manner, as most of the time will be spent in code rather than in slides.  The intent is to demonstrate (by using a real-world example, not slides and theory) the importance of having/creating well written unit tests before updating production code, and will be targeted to persuade the developer who is not yet sold on writing a solid suite of unit tests.  During the session, we will take an production existing framework and make changes to it using the following techniques:
 
1)      Use unit tests to ensure existing functionality does not break
2)      Use Code Digger to ensure that we test all possible code paths
3)      Use Fakes (including both Stubs and Shims) to isolate code paths and create targeted unit tests

## Title: StreamInsight in action: Monitoring website performance in real time
 
**Abstract**:
You may have heard of StreamInsight but what can it be used for? While there are a wide variety of use cases, we will look at one in particular ... how to monitor your website in real time with StreamInsight. In this session, we'll hook into the ASP.NET pipeline to send information to StreamInsight and integrate diagnostic information from Windows into a single dashboard of your website's performance as it is running. We'll see how StreamInsight can provide valuable analytics that allow you to gain valuable information ... not from web or event logs after the fact ... but while your site is running and you can respond to potential issues before they become visible to your users.

## Title: Attributes  Hierarchies in Analysis Services 2012
 
**Abstract**:
The session explains Attributes and Hierarchies in Analysis Services 2012 Semantic Model. They are used to slice (filter) and dice (group) measures and dimensions used to view analytical data.  The slicing and dicing of data involves fields, columns, or whatever you want to labeled them. But, in SQL Server Semantic model these are called Attributes and Hierarchies. The configuration of these slicers and dicers are important in SQL Server Analysis Services. This session will demonstrate the difference between an attribute and columns in a hierarchy in the dimension as well as the configuration of these for best performance and viewing.

## Title: Improving Performance, Backups, and the Development Lifecycle with Centralized Storage
 
**Abstract**:
Nimble Storage arrays provide I/O optimization and protection features that greatly benefit SQL Server implementations. It is important to first understand some of the internal I/O processes that SQL Server uses to store data on disk. Then you can use this fundamental understanding to implement best practices for provisioning a database storage design that will optimize performance and eliminate database backup windows. Using these best practices can also dramatically reduce recovery time objectives for full databases as well as individual database objects and data after user error and system failures.

## Title: Configuring and Managing FILESTREAM and FileTable
 
**Abstract**:
FILESTREAM and FileTable offer attractive solutions for applications that need to store large binary data (BLOBs) alongside relational data. With the benefit of the SQL Server storage engine managing the BLOB data but without the downsides of VARBINARY(MAX), FILESTREAM and FileTable have advantages that no other solution offers. This session will demonstrate how to design and create databases with these features. Because the paradigm is different than relational storage, the management aspect of FILESTREAM will also be examined, including transactional integrity, the garbage collector and backup and restore.

## Title: iPhone Apps in C#
 
**Abstract**:
Mobile development has traditionally been having to learn a new language for that platform and new ways of doing the same ‘ole thing. Cross-platform development has been especially burdensome since that means multiple code-bases in different languages that have to be kept in sync. Mono aims to make cross-platform mobile development easier by leveraging your existing .NET skills. You no longer need to spend your time re-learning the wheel and hopefully you can save even more time by sharing the majority of your code across all of the platforms. In this session, we will be looking specifically into the iOS platform and how to get started writing iPhone apps in C# and hopefully Visual Studio.
