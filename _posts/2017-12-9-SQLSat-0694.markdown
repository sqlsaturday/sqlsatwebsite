## Title: Choosing technologies for a big data solution in the cloud
 
**Abstract**:
Has your company been building data warehouses for years using SQL Server?  And are you now tasked with creating or moving your data warehouse to the cloud and modernizing it to support “Big Data”?  What technologies and tools should use?  That is what this presentation will help you answer.  First we will level-set what big data is and other definitions, cover questions to ask to help decide which technologies to use, go over the new technologies to choose from, and then compare the pros and cons of the technologies.  Finally we will show you common big data architecture solutions and help you to answer questions such as: Where do I store the data?  Should I use a data lake?  Do I still need a cube?  Do I need the power of MPP?  Should I build a "logical data warehouse"?  And we'll close with showing some architectures of real-world customer big data solutions.  Come to this session to get started down the path to making the proper technology choices in moving to the cloud.

## Title: Mapping Schema and Recursively Managing Data
 
**Abstract**:
Deleting, mapping, updating, or otherwise manipulating data in a highly relational environment can be a big challenge!  This is a dive into how we can effectively map out these relationships and use that information to make carefully planned changes to that data.

We will build from the ground up a script that will allow you to gain complete insight into the structure of a relational database.  Not only will this provide a complete map of relationships given a specific SELECT statement, but the TSQL can then be used to generate DELETE and UPDATE statements given that information.  Optimization techniques will be applied to this script to ensure that it executes efficiently, even on a large database.

Can gaining insight into relational structure and design be educational and fun?  YES!!!

## Title: Think like the Cardinality Estimator
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server uses a phase during query optimization, called cardinality estimation (CE). This process makes estimates bases on the statistics as to how many rows flow from one query plan iterator to the next.  Knowing how CE generates these numbers, will enable you to write better TSQL code and in turn influence type of physical operations during a query execution.  Based on that estimated rows, the query processor decides how to access an object, which physical join to use, how to sort the data.  Do you know how the CE generates these numbers?  What happen when you have multiple predicates, range predicates, variable values that are “NOT KNOWN” to the optimizer or you have predicate values increasing in ascending order? Do you know what will happen if your predicate is using a value that is outside of histogram range?  In this session, I will show you how CE estimates in all of these scenarios and you will walk out better equipped to tackle those nasty, hard to solve query plans.

## Title: Does it Hurt When I Do This? Performing a SQL Server Health Check
 
**Abstract**:
How often do you review your SQL Servers for basic security, maintenance, and performance issues?  Many of the servers I "inherit" as a managed services provider have quite a few gaping holes. It is not unusual to find databases that are never backed up, servers with constant login failures (is it an attack or a bad connection string?), and servers that need more RAM/CPU/etc. (or sometimes that even have too much!) 

Come learn how to use freely available tools from multiple layers of the SQL Server stack to check your servers for basic issues like missing backups and CheckDB as well as for more advanced issues like page life expectancy problems and improper indexing. If you are responsible in any way for a Microsoft SQL Server (DBA, Windows Admin, even a Developer) you will see value in this session!

## Title: Efficient and Effective coding of Stored Procedures
 
**Abstract**:
Data does not become information until decision makers are able to view it and make those decisions that affect the enterprise as a whole. Stored procedures are one means of getting the data from the database tables to the reports in an effective and efficient manner.
In this hands-on presentation, we shall be looking at best practices with regards to creating and tuning stored procedures. We shall also be discussing parameter sniffing and other gotcha’s that affect us in our daily lives.

## Title: I lost my job!  Now what?!?  A survival guide for the unemployed
 
**Abstract**:
You've just been told by HR that you are no longer a part of their organization.  You've been kicked to the curb.  You are now living in the no-man's land called unemployment.

Unemployment is a scary situation.  You're dealing with emotions and uncertainty.  You don't know if you'll be out of work for days, weeks, or months.

Fortunately, unemployment is survivable.  In this session, I'll share my own experiences (and perhaps we'll talk about some of yours) with unemployment, and how I managed to get through the tough times.  We'll discuss emotional impact, the job hunt, and things you can do to get yourself through this tough time.  Hopefully, you'll land on your feet once again before long!

## Title: Azure SQL Databases: A Guided Tour
 
**Abstract**:
You know about the cloud but you’re not there yet. Is it hard? Is it easy? How do you get started? Come to this session and see for yourself. We’ll start with nothing and end up with a deployed Azure SQL Database. We’ll even run a quick PowerBI report and enable Geo-Redundant Disaster Recovery with a few clicks.

The goal is to take the mystery out, to show the capabilities and get you thinking about what going to the cloud could look like and what it can do for you and your company. I believe the future belongs to those who have this knowledge and know where to apply it.

This will be nearly PowerPoint free and we’ll log into my Azure Portal and build out an environment from scratch and learn as we go. We’ll migrate data from an “on-premises” database into our SQL DB and we’ll query it. You’ll leave with an understanding of the capabilities, some resource links outlining what we did and hopefully some curiosity to see what else is up there in the cloud as you start exploring.

## Title: You Can Tune Your Own Code - Back to Basics Tips for Developers
 
**Abstract**:
In this talk, Mike will show us some of the tools that come with SQL Server and how they can be used to analyze the performance of our database code. We will take a quick walk through indexing basics, best practices, some quick tips and then have a more in depth look at Execution Plans, IO Statistics and the free Plan Analyzer tool from SQL Sentry.

Plus as a DBA, Mike can give a few pointers in working with your organization's own "Dr. No" along the way. Rough Agenda: • Review of Best Practices • Indexing/Table Structure High Level Overview • Will your queries use the index? • Query Plans don’t have to be scary • IO Statistics, Profiler • Put Them Together (Use the tools before you say, "Done!" • Interaction with the DBA (How to be a partner in performance with the DB). 

This is a gentle introduction of the basics that will help you write better code.

## Title: Should I move my database to the cloud?
 
**Abstract**:
So you have been running on-prem SQL Server for a while now.  Maybe you have taken the step to move it from bare metal to a VM, and have seen some nice benefits.  Ready to see a TON more benefits?  If you said "YES!", then this is the session for you as I will go over the many benefits gained by moving your on-prem SQL Server to an Azure VM (IaaS).  Then I will really blow your mind by showing you even more benefits by moving to Azure SQL Database (PaaS/DBaaS).  And for those of you with a large data warehouse, I also got you covered with Azure SQL Data Warehouse.  Along the way I will talk about the many hybrid approaches so you can take a gradual approve to moving to the cloud.  If you are interested in cost savings, additional features, ease of use, and ending the days of upgrading hardware, this is the session for you!

## Title: Azure SQL Database – not just a cloud version of SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server originally shipped in 1989. A full 20 years later, in 2009, Microsoft announced SQL Azure, currently known as Azure SQL Database. What is it? Is Azure SQL Database a hosted version of SQL Server? A subset? A superset? Actually, none of those simple explanations really capture it. Come join cloud computing veteran Bill Wilder to dig into the topic and go over the key differences between them, understand your cloud options, with a focus on how you would put Azure SQL Database to work today, including deploying, managing, securing, scaling, and DR enabling.

By the end of this session you should have a feel for how your SQL Server skills transfer to Azure SQL Database, which aspects of management  control Microsoft takes on, and how to use the toolbox of goodies for encryption, threat detection, DR, and global scale.

## Title: Making Life Easy With PowerShell
 
**Abstract**:
Do you like making things easy for yourself? Are you a database professional who has yet to feel comfortable with PowerShell? Then this session is for you. 
In this demo heavy session I will go over how a DBA can use PowerShell to make life easier when dealing with common, and not so common, issues and tasks. I will show you real world examples of how PowerShell and SQL Server work together, like peanut butter and jelly, to help you solve problems. We'll go on a magical journey from brief overview and simple scripts to advanced functions and modules. Leveraging the power of PowerShell we'll iterate over instances, audit servers, migrate instances, manipulate SSRS subscriptions and much more.

## Title: How to migrate a SQL database to Microsoft Azure SQL V12
 
**Abstract**:
There are many tools available to successfully migrate your on-premises relational database to Microsoft Azure SQL V12 database.  Do you know what tools are available for migration? How do you choose the best tool for you?  How do you analyze what objects are not compatible for migrating to Azure? It depends on the type, size and complexity of the database being migrated. In this demo based session I will show you 4 different tools, that you can use to analyze/migrate your on-premises SQL Database to Microsoft Azure SQL V12.  We will migrate a single database using 4 different tools so you know what options are available for you. I will also talk about where you can download and how you can set up these tools. Briefly talk about pros and cons of each tool. At the end of this session you will be aware of the various techniques available to analyze and migrate SQL Database to Azure V12 and chose the best fitting one for your database.

## Title: PowerShell Cubed: Backing up and Restoring Analysis Services Cubes with PowerShell
 
**Abstract**:
Did you know that the SQLPS module, now called SqlServer module, includes everything that you need to backup, restore, and many other things of SQL Analysis Services cubes? 

Far too often sessions cover using PowerShell to backup and restore SQL Server databases, but not backup and restores of AS cubes. This is NOT a talk about what AS is or how to build a new cube. This is a talk about AS management from the perspective of a DBA. We’ll talk about different ways to perform a backup and ways to perform a restore with PowerShell.

## Title: Dealing with Data Quality Issues in an SSIS Data Flow
 
**Abstract**:
Anyone who has worked with SSIS has dealt with the frustration of poor data quality and cryptic error messages. Microsoft has gotten better at providing better error messages within the Data Flow task, but still falls short in some areas.  In this session we will discover how to get the real error message in a data flow task and how to isolate the rows causing the errors.  We will start by reviewing a solution developed using a script component and progress to a method used to identify data quality issues before an error occurs.  We will also discuss other options to handling data quality and errors.

## Title: Optimizing Queries
 
**Abstract**:
Queries are tuned after the fact and the first performance trick that any developer / DBA uses is to slap on an index. Knowing how to re-write the query before adding an additional Index and coding with performance in mind sets a good developer apart.

*Track and Room*: Application  Database Development - Room C
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
 
## Title: Tracking Index Usage Like a Pro!
 
**Abstract**:
Effective indexing is key to query tuning, performance optimization, and resource management.

Knowing which indexes are used most (or least) often can help us determine which are no longer 
needed, or which could use some tweaking.  Keeping track of indexes that are missing and could greatly help performance allows us to solve related performance problems before they become disasters.

In this session, we will discuss how SQL Server tracks index utilization and the ways that we can persist this data for future use.  Once we have a collection process in place, we can easily report on it and make smart decisions using months of collected data.
