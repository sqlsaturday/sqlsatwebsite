## Title: IO, IO, Why's my SQL Slow?
 
**Abstract**:
Disk I/O can be a significant performance bottleneck for SQL Server. And when physical I/O is the suspected culprit, the first thought is to purchase more storage. But expensive hardware upgrades don’t necessarily ensure a faster database. So how do you determine how much I/O is contributing to poor performance? How can you assess the performance of a specific workload on different types of storage? And how do you decide which infrastructure is best for a specific storage solution?  

This presentation will cover :
The difference between latency, throughput, IOPS, and how they relate.
Performance characteristics of several storage solutions.
Techniques for analyzing storage subsystem performance.
How database design and infrastructure interact and impact performance and scalability.

## Title: SQL Server Maintenance Plans
 
**Abstract**:
Most DBA’s know you need to be doing some form of maintenance on your databases: Backups, index rebuilding\reorganization, update statistics, integrity checks, and system cleanup.  SQL Server offers some basic tasks to complete this needed maintenance. The session will cover setting up a maintenance plan including the tasks, schedules, and logging. From there, we will dive deeper into the basic task, find out what is going on behind the scene, and discuss when it is OK to use them and when you should create your own.  At the end of the session you will know how to create a maintenance plan, how to log results and keep a history of success or failures, when you should use what SQL Server has provided and when you should create your own plan.

## Title: SQL Server Backups and Restores A to Z
 
**Abstract**:
Have you become the de facto DBA? Have you been tasked with the responsibility of backing up your databases? Do you feel that your database maintenance plan is adequate, but may be lacking in what it can do?  If these scenarios sound familiar, you’ll want to join this session, where Microsoft Certified Master (MCM) Keith Tate will walk you through the basics of backup and restore options. 
The session will begin with the reasons why databases must be backed up (hint: to restore them). Then, discuss the different recovery models and how they affect your backup strategy. Next, explore ways to automate backup and restore strategies, and review ways to improve the speed of your backups and restores. Finally, put it all together and you’ll be on your way to a disaster proof backup and restore strategy.

## Title: Getting started with Dimensional Modeling
 
**Abstract**:
Technology has revolutionized the way organizations run today. Rather than a few file cabinets, organizations use many different software packages and applications that are mission critical to running their business. These systems gather a large amount of valuable data that must be used in decision making to maintain a competitive advantage. However, we've all heard and likely been around when mission critical systems have been rendered useless due to long running reports. To solve this and a host of other source system reporting issues we have proven Data Warehousing techniques to store the data in a report friendly way. Dimensional modeling is one of the most widely used set of techniques that will provide source system relief for reporting. In this session, we will take a look at what Dimensional Modeling is along with some key terms and techniques.

## Title: An Unexpected Journey: SQL Server 2000 to 2014
 
**Abstract**:
As a DBA yourself, I’m sure you’ve encountered instances where the SQL Server has been running fine, there’ve been no changes for ages, everything is stable, there’s no exposure to the outside world, and the last time anyone updated or applied a patch to the server was in February 2004… …and then the world intruded, and all of a sudden you’ve been given a directive to “bring that system up to date!” Now what? You’re faced with upgrading not only the SQL Server, but the Windows server as well (and a bunch of other applications), because Microsoft has announced that ALL support for Windows Server 2003 will be going away (far away!) this summer! And some clever person upstairs decided that it would be A GOOD THING to have this SQL Server exposed to the outside…and has commissioned the web dev team to build a whole suite of apps that WILL MAKE THE COMPANY MILLIONS! Where to start…

## Title: The Augean Stables:  Data Cleansing in the Modern Enterprise
 
**Abstract**:
Every database professional knows the database design ideal and we have all seen that ideal on numerous occasions -  databases in perfect third normal form;  constraints and relational integrity rigorously enforced; elegant error handling in every SQL statement;  data so clean you can eat off it.

Unfortunately we’ve only seen this ideal in textbooks and sample databases designed by vendors.  

The databases we see in the real world are… less than ideal shall we say.  Of course, we use other phrases for what we see but human resources frowns on such terms and this is, after all, a family friendly presentation.  
Database professionals in Greece circa 600 BCE may have access to the Alpheus and Peneus rivers to cleanse their particular stables but we modern folks need to rely on the tools on our own computers such as SQL and SSIS.  Mike will review various techniques and tools for data cleansing that will help you wash away the muck to get to the data gold standard.

## Title: The Life Cycle of a Query in 3D
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever wondered what really happens behind the scenes when you execute a query? In this unique demonstration, Todd will use a video game engine (Unreal Engine 4) and will dramatically show The Life Cycle of a Query in 3D. We will follow a query from beginning to end and "runthrough" the various SQL Server components all queries must use including the Protocol Layer, Relational Engine, Storage Engine, Buffer Pool and then back out to the client. A volunteer at the end will then don an Oculus Rift DK2 Virtual Reality headset and then race through the sections in under a minute to win a prize. Participants will leave with a better understanding of the major components and with a conceptual framework to explore the components more in-depth.

## Title: Tips for SQL Server Performance and Resiliency
 
**Abstract**:
After working 20 years in the industry on hundreds of SQL Servers clear patterns emerge. These observations of patterns and best practices directly relate to the health of the server.#160; During this session we will review the patterns of healthy SQL Servers and identify unhealthy behavior that clearly shows servers that are at risk.#160;
We will review shared patterns, configuration and practices.#160;#160; Which of these repeating patterns represent healthy Servers and which of these patterns are#160; shared with servers that are having issues daily.#160;
These patterns are so clear in fact that I many SQL Servers will benefit from the application of at least one if not more of the tips we will cover.#160; At the end of this session attendees will have the tools to identify and correct common issues that impact SQL Servers Performance and Resiliency.

## Title: Right-Sizing Your SQL Server Virtual Machine
 
**Abstract**:
Virtualizing your top-tier production SQL Servers is not as easy as P2V’ing it. Sometimes allocating more resources to the VM is the wrong approach, and getting it wrong will silently hurt performance. What is the most effective method for determining the ‘right’ amount of resources to allocate? What happens if the workload changes a month from now?

The methods for understanding the performance of your mission-critical SQL Servers gathered over the past ten years of SQL Server virtualization will be addressed, and valuable processes for performance statistic collection and analysis will be displayed. Come learn how to properly ‘right-size’ the resources allocated to a VM, improve the performance of your SQL Servers, and keep it maximized well into the future.

## Title: Hadoop and SQL Together: Modern Data Warehouse Design Patterns
 
**Abstract**:
No question about it, Hadoop is here and enterprises large and small are starting to embrace it. The adoption rate of Hadoop is making some EDW professionals anxious about this technology replacing their tried and true relational data warehouse.  This is a worry that need not be had.

In this session, we'll go through several design patterns that show how Hadoop can augment an existing relational data warehoue, and show WHY we need both technologies to cover the broad spectrum of reporting an analytics.

This session is largely conceptual, although we will cover a few code examples to show how some of the Hadoop technologies work in conjunction with SQL Server as a data warehousing platform.

## Title: Sentiment Analysis with Big Data
 
**Abstract**:
People’s sentiments and opinions are written in social networks. There are tweets, Facebook posts, book reviews, forum discussions, and more. These attitudes and feelings are communicated using text, with format depending on the social network. Twitter messages are limited to 140 characters and use hash-tags,; Facebook messages can be longer. This session reviews the different Natural Language Processing, text mining, and data mining techniques you can use for sentiment and tone analysis. Organizations can use the extracted knowledge for brand reputation, market predictions, and automatic learning. We’ll look at, Hadoop, data mining, Microsoft Big Data Hadoop distribution HDInsight and Azure Machine Learning

## Title: Getting Started with Extended Events
 
**Abstract**:
Few subjects in Microsoft SQL Server inspire the same amount of Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) as Extended Events.  Many DBA's continue to use Profiler and SQL Trace even though they have been deprecated for years.  Why is this?

Extended Events started out in SQL Server 2008 with no user interface and only a few voices in the community documenting the features as they found them.  Since then it has blossomed into a full feature of SQL Server and an amazingly low-impact replacement for Profiler and Trace.

Come learn how to get started - the basics of sessions, events, actions, targets, packages, and more.  We will look at some base scenarios where Extended Events can be very useful as well as considering a few gotchas along the way.  You may never go back to Profiler again!

## Title: An Introduction to Hadoop Development
 
**Abstract**:
Big Data has moved beyond the hype and entered the mainstream as a tool for managing large and unstructured data sets, giving data architects more options for managing data. The Hadoop ecosystem has become the tool of choice and Microsoft has entered this arena with HDInsight in the cloud. For DBAs this means having a place to store data that can be accessed using a highly parallel framework. In this session you’ll see how to use the numerous tools available to store data in Hadoop, process it, manage it, and retrieve it. We’ll explore Sqoop and how its many options can be configured to import data by taking advantage of Hadoop’s massive parallelism. We will develop and run Map\Reduce code, with an emphasis on understanding what belongs in a mapper function versus what belongs in a reducer function, while demonstrating Hadoop Streaming with languages such as R and C#.  Finally, Hive will be shown to exhibit the use of a high-level query language in Hadoop for those who prefer SQL.

## Title: Are You Optimistic About Concurrency?
 
**Abstract**:
What exactly does it mean to have optimistic concurrency? What is the alternative? Is SQL Server 2012's SNAPSHOT Isolation optimistic?  How can SQL Server 2014's In-Memory OLTP provide truly optimistic concurrency? 

In this session, we'll look at what guarantees the various isolation levels provide, the difference between pessimistic and optimistic concurrency, and the new data structures in SQL Server 2014 that allow the enormous benefits of having totally in-memory storage with no waiting!
