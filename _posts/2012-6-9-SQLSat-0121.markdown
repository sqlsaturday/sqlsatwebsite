## Title: Working with Server Side Traces
 
**Abstract**:
You may have heard that it’s a good idea to use a server-side trace to capture SQL profiler data, but do you know how to create one? And, do you know how to process the data you’ve captured?  If not, then this session is for you.

First, we’ll examine the anatomy of a server-side trace script and look at the different ways it can be customized. Then, we’ll talk about methods for stopping and starting the trace, how to know what traces are already running, and ways to schedule a trace to start under certain server conditions. Last, we’ll look at different tools available to you for analyzing the data you’ve gathered, including the SQL Server Profiler client application, “home-grown” T-SQL queries, ClearTrace, and the ReadTrace.

## Title: You’re My Density: Making Sense of Statistics
 
**Abstract**:
The Query Optimizer uses statistics to decide how to execute a query. If statistics are out of date, improperly sampled or simply don’t exist, then you could unintentionally deceive the Optimizer. Accurate statistics can help avoid poor query plans, so if you’re not familiar with how to read a histogram, the various options for updating statistics or want to know why sample size does matter, this session is for you! We will also delve into what happens when a value doesn’t exist in a statistic, discuss methods to manage statistics for volatile tables and examine the challenges that exist with statistics on partitioned tables. Expect a session filled with demos and real-world examples that will create a foundation of statistics knowledge.

## Title: Building Your First Tabular Model
 
**Abstract**:
With the release of SSAS 2012 Microsoft has introduced a new BI storage engine. In addition to the traditional OLAP engine you now have the option to build your BI models on top of the new Vertipaq engine. To use the new Vertipaq engine you build a Tabular data model.  A new query language DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is used to query the data, create calculations, measures, and KPI’s.This session is designed to introduce you to the process of building a tabular model in SQL Server Data Tools (BIDS rebranded). We will import data from a SQL Server relational database into a tabular model project and create relationships between the tables. We will use DAX to create and manage calculations, measures, and Key Performance Indicators

## Title: MongoDB for the Relational DBA
 
**Abstract**:
NoSQL is the buzzword of the moment, and MongoDB is the leader of the pack. Its probably running in your enterprise in production, and eventually its going to break. As a DBA its your job to fix it when it breaks, and back it up before it does.After all, there's not RELATIONAL in DBA.

On the technical side, this talk will focus on what a DBA needs to know about running MongoDB on windows. This includes setting it up as a service, importing and querying data, and of course backing up and restoring the database.

On the non-technical side, this talk will focus on when you would want to use MongoDB, and when you would not want to.

## Title: Thwarting Database Defects
 
**Abstract**:
It’s bad enough to spend hours finding and fixing database defects, explaining to the rest of the team what went wrong and trying to clean up the mess. It’s even worse when a defect causes the end-user to make a bad decision. Database defects are far too costly and most testing practices do not adequately detect or prevent them. This presentation introduces tSQLt, a framework for automated database unit testing. You’ll learn techniques to write SQL code that is resilient to defects and is easier to change and maintain.

## Title: Best Practices for Monitoring Databases on VMware
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server on VMware???  Many of our customers are either virtualizing databases or planning to do so soon. I hear from many groups that attempted running their database on VMware but went back to physical hardware because of performance issues. There are many reasons this may have happened, but quite often the decision to go back to physical was not based on hard facts. This presentation will explore the fundamentals of monitoring databases running in a VMware environment. If you are using classic O/S monitoring tools, you may be getting misleading data. Understand what metrics are important and how to get to that data.

## Title: Avoiding "Monkey At The Monitor" By Delegating
 
**Abstract**:
As a DBA there is a lot of simple, step-by-step work that has to be completed on a daily basis. And while it's obviously a necessary part of our job, it's not fun and it takes away from time we could spend doing more important, less urgent work. One attractive option is delegating work to others, thus allowing the DBA to focus on more attractive / important tasks. But how do we do so without compromising security or best practices? Using the tips and tricks presented in this session, you'll be able to spread your workload to junior personnel while still maintaining a sound security / audit model.
