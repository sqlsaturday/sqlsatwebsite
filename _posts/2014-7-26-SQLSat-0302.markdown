## Title: Creating Access 2013 Web Apps based on SQL Azure using SharePoint
 
**Abstract**:
Access 2013 web apps feature a new, full integration with SQL Azure. When you create a web app on SharePoint, Access Services will create SQL Azure database that houses all of your Access objects. This opens up new opportunities for SQL developers to extend and work with the data in Access apps.  In this session you will learn to easily create an Access Web Apps with automatic views, view the online development environment and see a real-world, production web app in action.  We’ll discuss different the use of hybrid applications and integrating office web apps as well as learn about app distribution, deployment and upgrades.  And lastly, see the pros/cons of Access Web Apps in a corporate environment.

## Title: Statistics and Query Optimization
 
**Abstract**:
There are any number of tricks and traps around getting the query optimizer to provide you with an optimal execution plan that gets you your data quickly and efficiently. But, at the end of the day, the principal driving factor of the optimizer, and therefore of your queries, are the statistics that define your data. This session teaches you how those statistics are put together and maintained by SQL Server. Different types of maintenance results in different levels of accuracy within statistics so we detail what the structures and information looks like after this maintenance. Your understanding of how the optimizer works with statistics will better enable you to understand why you’re getting the performance and types of execution plans that you are getting. Understanding enables you to write better t-sql statements and deal with performance problems such as bad parameter sniffing.

## Title: Effective use of temporary tables
 
**Abstract**:
Abstract:

Every developer eventually comes against business logic that can’t be handled with a single simple or complex query. TSQL provides the developer with several constructs that can store temporary result sets that are passed to the next query in the script.

I will be covering these various TSQL techniques with examples using the [AdventureWorks] database as well as a toy database called AUTOS. The pros and cons of each construct will be examined. Advanced options like enabling trace flag 1118 will be explored.

Coverage:

1 – Derived tables.
2 – Local temporary tables.
3 – Global temporary tables.
4 – Table variables.
5 – Common Table Expressions (CTE).
6 – User databases in [tempdb].
7 – Trace Flag 1118.

## Title: Geekin’ Out on Extended Events -Deconstructing the system_health session to solve performance issues
 
**Abstract**:
Extended Events are used to gather a wide range of performance information to help troubleshoot performance problems in SQL Server. The system_health session is an Extended Events session that is included by default with SQL Server. This session starts automatically when the SQL Server database engine starts, and runs without any noticeable performance effects. This presentations will take you on an in-depth tour of the data provided in the system_health event session and how to use it to troubleshoot performance issues. Cases studies from real-life examples will be used to demonstrate tips and tricks.

## Title: PowerShell for Database Developers
 
**Abstract**:
PowerShell has become the backbone of Windows Administrators but not heavily adopted by SQL Developers and this presentation is out to change that.  Do you ever need to encrypt, decrypt, zip, unzip, combine files, export to csv format , import from csv format, move, copy, rename, even provide a nice interface to some powerful script you wrote?  Bryan will even demonstrate how a PowerShell script can automatically navigate web pages doing tasks for you on the internet.  In short, there is nothing PowerShell can't do an if you are a SQL Developer or DBA, you need to be leverage its Power!

## Title: DANGER: The Art and Science of Presenting
 
**Abstract**:
Is there a great difference in the brain chemistry of someone fleeing a hungry mountain lion and someone presenting to a group of colleagues in a corporate board room? The answer is: NO. Over the past decade, a lot has been learned about the chemistry of the brain and why humans react the way we do to events in our environment. The concept of EQ (Emotional Intelligence) is a compelling and growing concept that applies this knowledge in a set of learnable, improvable skills for leading human beings. While EQ is often applied to corporate leadership, the parallels to presenting are fantastic. This session will explain the basics of EQ and demonstrate how you can apply it to make your presentations better in the following areas: * Crafting better slide decks * Preparing yourself for presenting * Delivering your content * Dealing with the unexpected Understanding and practicing the concepts of EQ can make your presentations a better experience for everyone in the room--including you.

## Title: MongoDB for the Relational DBA
 
**Abstract**:
NoSQL is the buzzword of the moment, and MongoDB is the leader of the pack. Its probably running in your enterprise in production, and eventually its going to break. As a DBA its your job to fix it when it breaks, and back it up before it does.After all, there's not RELATIONAL in DBA.

On the technical side, this talk will focus on what a DBA needs to know about running MongoDB on windows. This includes setting it up as a service, importing and querying data, and of course backing up and restoring the database.

On the non-technical side, this talk will focus on when you would want to use MongoDB, and when you would not want to.

## Title: Remove the Linked Server 2 Hop Limitation by Implementing Kerberos
 
**Abstract**:
Some of us have had to experience SSPI, untrusted domain, for login failed for NT Authority\Anonymous Logon errors can have come to the conclusion that there is a limitation when using windows authentication and linked servers. This is actually a limitation to the authentication method and not the linked servers. By implementing the new Kerberos authentication method in your Active Directory environment, you can overcome this 2 hop limitation.
