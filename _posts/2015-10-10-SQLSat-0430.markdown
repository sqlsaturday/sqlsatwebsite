## Title: My Favorite Pie (Chart)
 
**Abstract**:
Pies are definitely fine for dessert :-) – but sometimes also used for reports, even if their real use case is very narrow. Do you want deliver information in an effective and efficient way? Do you think, this is crucial for you a business’ success? Even when attractiveness of a report is important, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Research shows that we can help end-users to understand the message of the data quickly by following some simple rules. You will see how you can implement those rules with Microsoft Excel's Tables and Charts and the Power View add-on – ending up with effective and efficient information delivering through beautiful dashboards. You will learn how to identify suboptimal dashboards and what you can do to improve them.

## Title: Introduction to Azure DocumentDB
 
**Abstract**:
Azure DocumentDB is a new highly-scalable NoSQL database platform on Microsoft Azure, designed as a fully managed cloud service for modern web and mobile applications. Like other NoSQL platforms, DocumentDB supports schema-free designs, and scales across replicas with fast write performance and eventual consistency. But DocumentDB also offers several unique features that make it a compelling candidate for NoSQL scenarios, which you will learn about in this session. The platform is based on HTTP/REST, embraces JSON as a standard document format, and is supported by a wide range of SDKs for .NET, JavaScript, Java, Python, and Node.js. Without defining any index paths, new documents are queryable within milliseconds, using SQL grammar or LINQ. Learn these and other capabilities, including server-side JavaScript-based stored procedures, user-defined functions, triggers, tunable consistency, and more.

## Title: Advanced Reporting Techniques  Managing Reports
 
**Abstract**:
Any data that we have today is delivered to end users as reports and dashboards.

=gt; When it is more than 50 reports, 10 departments, 300 users, how to manage the department categories by folders, reports, users, groups  security?
=gt; What are the techniques to implement linked reports, subscriptions, report history, snapshot options?
=gt; How to edit reports using browser based Report Builder and reuse some of the report parts?
=gt; How to build a report that is very simple to use but has advanced capabilities?
=gt; How do I see the subscription information that stores data in XML format within ReportServer database?
=gt; How to take ownership of a deployed report(s) using T-SQL and is it healthy modifying the data using T-SQL directly on the DB?

There are plenty of things that we can do with Reporting services, Report Manager and you can find answers for all above questions in this session.

This session also helps you identify the performance bottleneck in poor performing SSRS s

## Title: Azure Data Factory vs SSIS, the Ins and Outs.
 
**Abstract**:
ADF provides a managed way to orchestrate the collection, movement and transformation of structured and semi-structured data together. It works both with on-premises and cloud data and it has - of course - a powershell interface, enabling you to manage it without the bling of the Azure portal. But is it useful, is it fast, is it easy and powerful to use ? And most of all is Azure Data Factory  the new SSIS ?
These are some of the questions that might arise, when reading about this new PaaS and that we will answer together in this demo packed session where will we go through orchestration, consumption and administration of data through the ADF pipeline.

## Title: The top 8 reasons for your transaction performance problems
 
**Abstract**:
Transaction is running slow! How many times you have seen this on your production system, how many times you heard have this from your users? It’s time to isolate issues and get them resolved!
There are common reasons for transaction delays like slow transaction log, page splits, blocking, over-indexing, and even some configuration settings of your database and/or instance. Query tuning tips are slightly different than those for transactions, this session is about OLTP performance troubleshooting. I will show you some typical scenarios of transaction delays and the reasons behind them. This will definitely help you in your performance troubleshooting efforts and will give you a good level of confidence.

## Title: Are your SQL Server indexes effective?
 
**Abstract**:
Indexes are important! They can make your life easy, but they can be a huge performance killer. No matter your role - DBA or DEV, you need to design effective indexing strategy and most importantly - know if those indexes are really effective. SQL Server gives you number of possibilities to track the use of your indexes and suggest you new ones. But what else we need to be careful for? How to keep our SQL Server in proper index shape? Join me for this one-hour session where we will have real fun on indexes and I promise you, you will leave with plenty of ideas for improving your index environment!

## Title: Easy ETL with Biml
 
**Abstract**:
Can ETL be fun? Unfortunately, very often creation of ETL layer is time-consuming, tedious, error-prone task. What’s more, any change in requirement needs most of the work to be redone. In our session we’ll present new approach to creating BI solutions using Biml language and Mist programming environment. They greatly simplify the process, allowing for amazing flexibility, and make the ETL work more pleasant. We will show real examples of how Biml and C# generates hundreds of usable SSIS packages in just couple of minutes. We will also cover integration of ETL with TFS and CI for ETL. Everything with 100% compatibility with unmodified SQL Server. Join us and see how BI just became fun again

## Title: Boosting DWH-Performance with SQL Server 2016
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2016 brings the topic "in-memory" to a new level. Not that previous versions did not hold as much as data as possible inside of memory through caching, but now we enter a new era: in-memory row stores, in-memory column stores and compiled stored procedures are different from what we have seen so far. In this session, you will see how you can leverage those new features and how you can come by existing limitations. Come back to office with the knowledge how to boost the performance of your ETL, queries and reports into the new era.

## Title: Exploring Optimistic Concurrency
 
**Abstract**:
The topic of SQL Server concurrency is for sure one of the most complex ones in the field. Locking, blocking, timeouts and performance issues are just some of the consequences of not choosing the proper isolation level for our applications. In this demo-intensive session we will not only talk, but actually go deep into optimistic concurrency and the two isolation levels it offers to us - Read Committed Snapshot and Snapshot isolation level. We will see how they work, how much they can help for the performance and scalability of our applications and what are the little gotchas we need to be aware of.

## Title: When SQL is not enough… there it comes Elasticsearch
 
**Abstract**:
Elasticsearch doubled its popularity during the last year and this is just one of the signs that something good is happening there. Yet this DB stays far behind the usual suspects like SQL Server and MySQL but there are areas where different technologies fit much better. One of these is complex and real-time search.
Elasticsearch builds on the top of the well-known Apache Lucene but is designed to easily scale and lay the foundation for modern search intensive applications. 
This session will draw your path into this relatively new technology, provide guidelines on its usage and practical advice on integration with your existing SQL Server solutions.

## Title: IoT and SQL (Server)
 
**Abstract**:
Or IoT for DBAs
And we are not talking about Oracle Index Organized Tables, we are talking about Internet of Things. This buzzword you hear almost everywhere, and for sure needs databases. So let’s take the Microsoft vision of IoT and see the database side of it. We will talk about the vision of IoT and the real world practicalities of it. The presentation goal is to provide a DBA all he/she needs to know to support an IoT application.  And to make you curious we will cover topics such SQL 2014 for Embedded Systems or the Azure offerings (and their SQL connections), and I will try full demos with IoT hardware.
