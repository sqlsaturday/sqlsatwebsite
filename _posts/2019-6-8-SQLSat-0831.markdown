## Title: Tame Your Unruly Data With Constraints
 
**Abstract**:
Bad data comes in many forms: duplicate rows, wrong data type, invalid values, and orphaned or missing foreign keys. Time is wasted cleansing, reviewing and correcting data, not to mention the potential hazards bad data can cause. This introductory presentation will explain the data types and constraints available in SQL Server, and how they can replace or augment business rules that would otherwise be written in application or procedure code. Performance benefits provided by constraints will be demonstrated. We will examine the various system views and procedures that describe constraints and how to use them to document your databases. You will be able to apply this knowledge to your database environments and see significant improvements in data quality, performance, and reliability.

## Title: dbatools 1.0  -  Updated, Cross Platform and ready for Production use.
 
**Abstract**:
The open source DBA Tools module from DBATools.IO was first released to PowerShell gallery on May 15 2016

In February 2019 the production ready 1.0 release is expected.

With more than 500+ commands, a comprehensive help system and coverage for almost all core Dba tasks knowledge of this PowerShell module should be required for any database professional that needs to use or support one or more SQL Server instances

In this session we will take a short look at the history of the module but will spend majority of time in examples of how it can be used to solve many common Database management tasks.

No prior experience with Powershell required!

## Title: Smart Alerts in SQL DB using Automation and Logic Apps
 
**Abstract**:
If you've played with Azure SQL DB, you'll know that there is no SQL Agent provided with the service.

Fortunately there's options available to get over this hurdle such as Azure Automation which can be used as a scheduling engine to run PowerShell or Python scripts to perform your tasks. However, Azure Automation Runbooks can also be triggered from Azure SQL DB alerts.

This session will introduce Azure Automation, from a basic manually executed Runbook to an alert-driven responsive utility that can save you considerable effort.

We'll then take our Alert responses a step further and use them to trigger an Azure Logic App workflow. Azure Logic Apps provide a robust workspace with built-in scalability and retry logic for your workflow along with many connectors which can expand the response to your alert.

Imagine capturing an Alert, performing remedial action, logging the issue  response in your ticketing system and switching on the kettle for a cuppa while Azure does all the work.

## Title: Ten Query Tuning Techniques Every SQL Programmer Should Know
 
**Abstract**:
SELECT statements have a reputation for being very easy to write, but hard to write very well. This session will take you through ten of the most problematic patterns and anti-patterns when writing queries and how to deal with them all.  Loaded with live demonstrations and useful techniques, this session will teach you how to take your SQL Server queries mundane to masterful.

Goal 1: Implement a reusable Transact-SQL test harness for reliable query results.
Goal 2: Learn ten patterns that kill the performance of SELECT statements and how to avoid them.
Goal 3: Discover the high-impact metadata that shows how a SELECT statement behaves … or misbehaves.

Attend this session to take your query writing and query tuning skills to the next level!

## Title: Provisioning Dev/Test environments efficiently (speed/storage) whilst protecting your data
 
**Abstract**:
As data professionals, we need to aim towards the most efficient way of provisioning production data to non-production environments while remaining compliant with data protection regulations.
We also need to make sure that this process is performed as quickly as possible and at the same time ensuring that it uses the least amount of storage.

With the effective usage of virtualization and data masking capabilities, provisioning full copies of protected databases takes a few seconds and saves up to 99% disk space.
SQL Provision helps create, protect and manage SQL Server database copies for compliant DevOps without increasing the risk of a data breaches.

On this session we will learn how to:
- Protec our data and Easily comply with regulations
- Create cloned databases (fast and with minimum storage requirements)
- Automate the provisioning process.

SQL Provision supports database DevOps while keeping compliance central to the process.

## Title: Bridging the gap between SSRS and Power BI
 
**Abstract**:
Traditionally, SSRS is used for paginated reports which gives flexibility like drill through reports, subscriptions and print formatting. With Power BI the reports are now more interactive and dynamic. There are still few gaps between these two platforms which are built to purpose. This gap is getting smaller as features are ported between these two platforms. In this session I will be going through various features which are bridging these gaps and point out the differences. These are significant and can affect your decision in choosing the right platform which will fit your needs.

## Title: Improved data models; what you need to increase the usability and speed of Power BI reports
 
**Abstract**:
Power BI is a great tool for ad-hoc analysis, but without considering the final purpose of the report, this will lead to poorly designed data models that replicate the tables structured from the source data. 
To ensure great usability, performance, adaptability and scalability, you need to apply some basic data modelling practices to your Power BI models. In this session, we will discuss:
•	How to interpret business peoples requirements to conceptualise the model
•	Planned development with tables structured in a star schema
•	Organisation-wide conformed dimensions
•	Moreover, how to apply all this theory to your actual models
