## Title: The New Revolution in Data Science, R integrated into SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Data Science is an ever increasing topic in the Data Analytics space and the R language is at the center of most conversations. R is an open source statistical language that is rapidly gaining popularity due to a robust set of machine learning functionality and a never-ending set of R packages.  

The R language is run as a desktop application and was not built with performance and scale required to accommodate Big Data. Revolution Analytics, a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft, has solved the performance and scaling issues of a desktop application by creating a more robust enterprise architecture. SQL Server 2016 brings the power of R and Revolution Analytics into the industry leading relational database. 

This session will introduce R and demonstrate the functionality and power of using R within SQL Server. 

This presentation is ideally suited for Business Intelligence professionals that are interested in understanding the new R Service that is being added to SQL Server.

## Title: SQL Server Integration Services for Data Science
 
**Abstract**:
Data science is the new buzz word in the IT community. How many times have you heard the term in recent meetings with your management or development teams? Businesses are looking to data science and advanced analytics to increase their competitive advantage. What does this mean to the Integration Services developer?

ETL developers play a key role in the success of a data science project. With your overall knowledge of the data integration architecture within your enterprise, you are in an excellent position to help with the next advanced analytics project at your company.

What are the additional skills needed to improve your role in the next data science project? In this presentation, we’ll discuss the data preparation and integration considerations that you will need.  

Some of the topics that will be covered in this session include:
•	Data Cleansing
•	Data Normalization/Discretization 
•	Missing Values
•	Noisy Data
•	Data Reduction 
•	Model Integration

## Title: SQL Server 2016 Always On Availability Groups Perf  Internals
 
**Abstract**:
Always On Availability Groups (AGs) were introduced in SQL Server 2012. AGs significantly expanded our HA/DR options. However, in both SQL 2012 and SQL 2014 two limitations were extant in the code—both Network Transport and Log Redo significantly compromised performance. In SQL Server 2016, these limitations have been significantly improved. 

Our work shows enhancements of 7x – 10x, allowing over 1/2GB/s (4Gb/s) across the wire. These improvements expand solutions options for Tier 1 OLTP and Data Warehouse workloads, Tier 1 and Tier 2 consolidation, and more. This presentation explains the improvements, characterizes the new solutions, and shows commodity servers and modern non-shared in-server flash storage showing the profound contrast between SQL Server 2014 vs. 2016. Doing so moves the performance bottleneck from the SQL Server codebase to the CPU where it belongs.

## Title: The Next Frontier-  Opportunities When Migrating to the Cloud with Virtualization
 
**Abstract**:
Cloud is everywhere and the database administrator is caught in the middle. How do you know where to start and what to migrate first? How do you perform consolidation planning and ensure data security? This session builds on a full demonstration, along with tips and tricks to show how the DBA can secure their environment to allow a self-service option so they no longer are the constraints to projects! The attendee will leave with a clear understanding of:
* Principles of virtualization and why it’s the answer to so many challenges we face today.
* How easy it is to secure data in the cloud using data masking features.
* The ease of connecting to the cloud and migrating environments.
* How to troubleshoot when issues arise and the tools available to diagnose issues.

## Title: Execution Plans for Mere Mortals
 
**Abstract**:
For beginning database professionals, execution plans can be intimidating. This 1-hour session takes you through the basics of reading graphical execution plans and drills into key operators, warnings, and properties. Learn how, why, and when an execution plan is created and saved to plan cache. 

Reading execution plans becomes much less intimidating as we walk through the flow and process of a graphical execution plan. After looking at the key operators, you will be able to analyze the operators of your execution plans, view the operator properties, and identify common performance-tuning opportunities. Finally, you will be able to capture the execution plan and save it for analysis and comparison after modifications.

## Title: Consolidated Essential Performance Health Check using PowerShell
 
**Abstract**:
Standardizing essential performance health check is the key in responding quickly to production issues and can cut down initial evaluation phase to 1/3rd of the time, whether you have been requested to do health check or you may want to run these due to an alert. These sets of essential checks can be the first major checkpoint for a DBA, they can look quickly on consolidated email stats first to decide if any further action is required to fix an issue or is it feasible to jump into in-depth troubleshooting. This will cut down on time and effort while responding to Production issues.

First part of the email shares some key observations about SQL Server performance which can be the key to quick resolution of the issue. Rest of the email shows different set of stats regarding CPU/Disk IO/Disk Space/Memory/Network/Blocking and database performance which could lead to the slowness observed in the application. This consolidated email can be shared with technical stakeholders to give a snaps

## Title: Smart Re-Indexing - The quest of ultimate automation
 
**Abstract**:
How many times you have been called on weekends to handle a nightmare caused by Re-Indexing job? One of the most common aspect of performance tuning is a well-design dynamic index optimization process. If you ever wonder what it takes to design an efficient re-indexing process, which perform selective re-indexing, handles blocking automatically, avoid system downtime due to log disk full, automatically stop itself beyond a threshold, can be implemented across all sql servers regardless of application type or data size, in other words, fewer headaches. This session is for you!!

## Title: Where did I put my (primary) keys?
 
**Abstract**:
In this session we will revisit some of the fundamental design principals of relational databases: normalization rules, key selection, and the controversies associated with these issues from a practical perspective.

## Title: Programming in Power Query: An Introduction to M
 
**Abstract**:
While the DAX language gets all of the Power BI attention and love, its partner M is nonetheless a powerful workhorse that can be harnessed to do amazing things. We will begin by introducing ourselves to the functional language by building a calendar -- absolutely necessary for all of those lovely DAX time intelligence functions to work. From establishing the time period in question to deciding on what information we need and how we want it presented, our understanding of M will grow as we progress through this construction.

We then look at what to do when the information you get is incomplete and contradictory. Cleaning up data and handling errors and missing data will be our focus in an example of combining multiple data sources into a single data set. We consider this crucial step in the ETL cycle.

Our examination will conclude with a discussion of best practices, centering on coding style and deciding on when to solve a problem with M versus when to rely on DAX.

## Title: But it worked great in Dev!  Perfomance for Devs
 
**Abstract**:
If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.
