## Title: XML and Relational Databases
 
**Abstract**:
Using established relational database principles can help us decide when and how to use the XML feature in SQL Server 2005 / 2008.

Contrary to typical technology presentations, this focuses on what we _should_ do over just a list of features and their syntax. The audience will learn what's missing from the typical understanding of "first normal form," how a correct understanding helps guide design decisions, and how to apply this to the design of databases where XML or other complex types are

## Title: Gaining SQL Server Insight with DMV's
 
**Abstract**:
This session will explore SQL Server 2005 DMV's.  During this session will explore what DMV's are, and how they can be used to obtain information that SQL Server has collected about your SQL Server environment.  Thing we will explore is how to identify indexes that have not been used, or indexes that SQL Server has identified that are missing.  Other thing we will explore is how to use DMV's to identify your most expensive queries by CPU, I/O and elpased time.

## Title: Changing role of the SQL Server DBA
 
**Abstract**:
In today’s world the role of the DBA is fast changing from been task orientated trouble shooter to the pro-active DBA who is monitoring the activities and resolving issues before the become apparent to the end user. Through the use of better tools both from with in SQL Server Management Studio and Third Party Vendors the ability of the DBA to monitor all the activities of a SQL Server makes the role of the DBA more pro-active.

## Title: Building Reports in SQL Server Reporting Services 
 
**Abstract**:
Using SQL Server Reporting Services can simplify designing reports, but how do you handle complex report requirements?  This session will discuss how to handle these complex scenarios by using the new features of SSRS 2008.  We will walk through building reports to showcase these situations.  This session will be friendly to people who have experience in either SSRS 2005 or SSRS 2008.

## Title: Practical Table Partitioning
 
**Abstract**:
Table partitioning can be a very way to manage very large tables and their indexes. In this presentation, you will learn about the practical issues of table partitoning, including choosing range direction, schema file placement, sliding and revolving windows, and partitioned indexed views. Partitioning features of both SQL Server 2008 and 2005 will be covered, and typical usage of the partiton-related DMVs and DMFs illustrated.

## Title: Introduction to SQL Server Hints
 
**Abstract**:
Most of the time, the SQL Server query optimizer does a great job of selecting an optimal query plan. On a rare occasion it does not, and when it does not, then hints are sometimes needed to help the query optimizer create an optimal query plan. In this session we will:

•	Learn when to use, and not to use hints
•	Learn how to implement commonly used hints
•	Learn hint best practices

## Title: Long parameter lists
 
**Abstract**:
Newbies coming from procedural languages whose procedures and functions allow non-scalar (i.e. non-1NF) parameters try to mimic familiar constructs in SQL by writing parsers for character strings or using proprietary XML extensions. The result is that they immediately lose all the power of declarative coding, parameter validation and performance.  Then the maintenance of the code becomes a problem. 

SQL Server cam easily handle a long list of parameters.  The code is not only safer but easy t
