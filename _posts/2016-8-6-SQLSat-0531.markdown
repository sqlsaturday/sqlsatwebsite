## Title: The Many Paths of Consulting
 
**Abstract**:
People often dream of becoming a consultant, but what does that actually mean? Is consulting really the right path for you? Many choices are available when deciding to become a consultant, but these options can be overlooked. Contracting, consulting for an established team, going out on your own, or looking to build a larger business are all great options, depending on your vision and future goals.

This session will help you ask the right questions to better chose and prepare for your path. We then explore the various realities and strategies of each path. Real-life experiences will be shared to help you make the most informed decision on which path is best for you, and how to accelerate your career as a consultant.

## Title: Let Me Finish... Isolating Write Operations
 
**Abstract**:
OLTP databases can be constantly written to and reporting databases are written to at least periodically. In order to ensure consistent results, connections must be isolated from one another while executing, ideally with the lowest possible cost to concurrency.  How this isolation is handled is based on the isolation level, whether the classic lock based or the newer optimistic scheme of the in-memory OLTP engine is used, or even if both engines are enlisted in the same transaction. In this session we will look at examples of how SQL Server isolates reading and writing operations from other writing operations to explore how this may affect your application through error messages and performance hits.

## Title: Statistics  Cardinality – How they work to find data efficiently
 
**Abstract**:
Are your statistics up to date? 
Yes, it’s that dreaded phrase you hear all the time when it comes to performance tuning your SQL Server. What does it matter? Why should I care about statistics? Aren’t they automatic or something like that?
In this session we will go over why statistics matter, how they are generated, how they impact performance, and even how to maintain them. Once we have that all settled, we will take a quick look at how the cardinality estimator uses statistics to determine a ‘good enough’ plan to use. We will close out the session by taking a look at the performance impact from a simple upgrade of your SQL Server to 2014 and using the new cardinality estimator.

## Title: Why “R” you not leveraging the power of “R” in Power BI?!?
 
**Abstract**:
R is a very powerful statistical programming language that has been gaining a lot of traction in recent years. In early 2015 Microsoft acquired Revolution Analytics, a major provider of software and services for R. Microsoft has since incorporated R in Azure ML, SQL Server 2016, and Power BI. 

In this session I will focus on the benefits of using R in Power BI. I will show how to leverage R for data munging (ETL) and I will also show how to leverage R to create custom visualizations. I will focus on the "Wickham stack" which is a group of very popular R packages developed by Hadley Wickham. The “Wickham stack” includes the ggplot2, dplyr, and tidyr packages. I will discuss logical use cases for using R within Power BI as well as some of the pitfalls that you may encounter.

## Title: Infrastructure for the DBA: An Introduction
 
**Abstract**:
It doesn’t matter if you are a Junior DBA, an accidental DBA or all the way up to a Senior DBA, the infrastructure your SQL Server environment runs on is important.  Many among the DBA community came in as developers or perhaps directly into database administration roles it is equally possible that you have been out of the operations world long enough to have fallen out of the loop with what is happening.  This session is intended to provide a full stack infrastructure overview so that you can talk shop with your cohorts in operations to resolve issues and maybe even be proactive.  We will discuss, in an introductory fashion, hardware, network, storage, virtualization and operating system layers.  Additionally, some suggestions as to where to find more information will be provided.

## Title: Introduction to the Power BI Desktop
 
**Abstract**:
Most of us are overwhelmed with data from all the different applications that we use on a daily basis.  Bringing all the data together is often a very time-consuming and sometimes a challenging process.  Even further, attempting to analyze and visualize the data poses new challenges that is sometime difficult or impossible to overcome.  Now with Power BI this can all be made very simple.  Individuals, ranging from novice information workers to advanced IT professionals can quickly and easily transform, analyze and visualize data using a single tool, Power BI Desktop.   In this course we will work through four main topics: Shaping Data, Building a Data Model, Visualizing Data and Using the Power BI Server.

## Title: Is your Flight on Time? – Power BI Dashboard
 
**Abstract**:
It’s easy to find useful data on the Internet, model the data and construct a BI Dashboard using Power BI Desktop.  The application used in this session shows on-time performance of domestic flights.
Using government data this is available, you can answer these questions:
1.	Which airlines have the best on-time performance?
2.	Which flights between airports are regularly on-time?
3.	What day of the week or month is best to fly to get there on time?
4.	Which airline has the most cancelations?
This session covers how to build, model, and deploy a Power BI Dashboard to PowerBI.com that reads flight data and displays aircraft flights on-time performance.  The session also shows how to use Power Query to get data from the web.  
Finally, see the Dashboard in action and also how to use QA, a natural-language search technology.  Also, see Quick “Data” Insights, which uses Cortana Analytics in the background to show additional insights and analysis using the existing data model.

## Title: Getting started with Always Encrypted in SQL Server 2016
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2016 significantly raises the bar in terms of data security.  One of the most exciting features introduced in the newest release of SQL Server is Always Encrypted.  This feature ensures that data remains encrypted in its entire lifecycle - at rest as well as in transit.  Additionally, the encrypted data can be made completely inaccessible to database administrators.  With the assistance of an updated .Net client-side driver, this great new feature ensures that applications can leverage Always Encrypted data without application code changes.  In this demo-rich session we will look at how to enable and configure Always Encrypted as well as how applications can be configured to use this amazing new technology.
