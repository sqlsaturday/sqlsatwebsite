## Title: What about the Data Dude? SSDT Database Projects
 
**Abstract**:
For years the database has been treated as a second class citizen when it comes to source, change, and version control, often thought of as a dumb data store.  Microsoft first addressed this with Visual Studio Team System 2008 Database Edition, aka "Data Dude".  After the release of Visual Studio 2012, Microsoft pulled the database project out of Visual Studio and created SQL Server Data Tools as separate, free to SQL Server users, install on top of the Visual Studio shell.  The database project was updates making managing databases as code much easier and making the database a first class citizen in the code world.  We will cover how to create a database project, connect it to source control, and deploy to our database servers.

## Title: Right-Sizing Your SQL Server Virtual Machine
 
**Abstract**:
Virtualizing your top-tier production SQL Servers is not as easy as P2V’ing it. Sometimes allocating more resources to the VM is the wrong approach, and getting it wrong will silently hurt performance. What is the most effective method for determining the ‘right’ amount of resources to allocate? What happens if the workload changes a month from now?

The methods for understanding the performance of your mission-critical SQL Servers gathered over the past ten years of SQL Server virtualization will be addressed, and valuable processes for performance statistic collection and analysis will be displayed. Come learn how to properly ‘right-size’ the resources allocated to a VM, improve the performance of your SQL Servers, and keep it maximized well into the future.

## Title: Building a Big Data Solution
 
**Abstract**:
As a follow-on to the presentation “Building an Effective Data Warehouse Architecture”, this vendor-free presentation will explain exactly what Big Data is and its benefits, including use cases.  We will discuss how Hadoop, the cloud and massively parallel processing (MPP) is changing the way data warehouses are being built.  We will talk about hybrid architectures that combine on-premise data with data in the cloud as well as relational data and non-relational (unstructured) data.  We will look at the benefits of MPP over SMP and how to integrate data from Internet of Things (IoT) devices.  You will learn what a modern data warehouse should look like and how the role of a Data Lake and Hadoop fit in.  The Big Data boom brings new challenges to those of you who define the architectures to create and consume business-critical data.  You will need guidance on the best solution for your data warehouse going forward.  This presentation will help to give you that guidance!

## Title: Data Pages, Allocation Units, IAM chains... Oh My!
 
**Abstract**:
Understanding how SQL Server stores your data can seem like a daunting task. In this session You'll learn how objects such as tables and indexes are stored in a data file. We’ll also look at how these concepts tie in to your work as a DBA or developer. We’ll see these concepts in action using demos and see how we can use this knowledge to better design solutions.

We’ll start off by looking at the structure of a row and then move on the concept of a data page. From there we’ll cover a few special page types like the index allocation map and GAM and SGAM pages. Then we’ll look at index structures and talk about the differences between heaps and clustered indexes.

## Title: 100 Times Faster: Experiences making SQL Server go fast
 
**Abstract**:
How do you go about making a program run a lot faster!  Like 100 times faster?   It’s difficult.  Microsoft tried in the Hekaton project, its in-memory tables feature of SQL 2014, and they got very close.  Inspired by that effort, this presentation looks at some recent cases where I’ve been able to achieve huge performance improvements in SQL Server code and how that happens.

When I work on SQL Server performance I emphasize that the first thing to think about is how to accomplish the task in a different way that will be much faster”.   Sometimes there’s a better algorithm.  Sometimes a different technology is more appropriate.  Sometimes it’s a combination of many changes that combine to create the desired outcome much, much faster. 

This presentation is illustrated with examples from my work and we'll look for common threads that might help us all.

## Title: Dissecting the Data Flow: SSIS Transformations, Memory  the Pipeline
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Integrations Services is a robust product, with lots of different options available to the ETL developer. For someone new to SSIS, it can be daunting to be assigned a project to extract data from a source, transform it and then load it into its intended destination. What components do I use? Why pick one over another? Even if you are new to SSIS, it's good to have an understanding of what's going on under the hood when a package is run. Come to this session to learn what non-blocking, semi-blocking and fully-blocking transformations are. We'll explore how SSIS creates and manages memory buffers. You'll leave with a better understanding of how certain tasks and transformations can affect your package’s performance.

## Title: Accelerating DevOps Using Data Virtualization
 
**Abstract**:
DevOps is the melding of application development, testing, and IT operations. All tasks from infrastructure to coding to testing to transition into production must be automated so that new features and fixes can be continuously delivered.

Constraining DevOps is data. Databases and applications have grown enormous and complex. "Storage is cheap" is a lie. Provisioning a full environment for each developer or tester on each task of each project appears unrealistic, when each might require several terabytes of storage. And so everyone is limited to working in a small handful of shared environments that are refreshed only every few months, and code quality suffers.

Data virtualization is the solution. Virtual databases and file-systems only consume space from deltas, so it is possible to provision multiple terabytes for megabytes. Coders and testers have full environments fast in which to develop and test, improving code quality.  Learn about the technical details behind this solution.
