## Title: Database Design Fundamentals
 
**Abstract**:
Before you get immersed in all the technical details of SQL Server, let's talk about the fundamentals.  What does it mean to normalize a database?  How do I pick a natural primary key vs. a sequence?  What about naming tables, views, columns, etc?  We will use the "chalk talk" format.  I will introduce a topic then ask the class to share their ideas and experiences with the topic.  We will have plenty of fundamentals to cover, so I will serve as moderator to keep us on track. Quoting cycling great Greg LeMond - "Perhaps the single most important element in mastering the techniques and tactics of racing is experience. But once you have the fundamentals, acquiring the experience is a matter of time."

## Title: SQL Server Preproduction Tasks
 
**Abstract**:
This session will cover the tasks you need to perform before you hand over a new SQL Server to production in order to keep the server running smoothly. After this session, you should be able to create a script that best suits your organization in order to make moving a server into production a quick and easy process.  While the session is geared towards new systems, many of these preproduction considerations apply to existing SQL Servers as well.

## Title: Streaming Applications using SQL Server 2008 Files
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2008 introduced the concept of the FILESTREAM support. Most DBAs whom have been around for a while have in one instance or another supported streaming applications by use of the VARBINARY(MAX) datatype in order to store file information within the database architecture. However, this has drastic limitations as the RDBMS are not typically set up to deal with data that is not accessible in terms of pages and extents. FILESTREAM support adds a new paradigm to the database platform by marrying the database system with the NTFS filesystem in order to overcome these old obstacles. In this session, we will delve into FILESTREAM support, what it takes to implement, and some of the extremely cool things that you can do with this new power

There are two C# .net console apps that run, which can also run as a service, that constantly checks the message queue. When
the app finds a message it processes it. The transformation and loading of the warehouse occurs here. Inside of the actual warehouse databases there is a schema named Meta. The schema houses information that is used by the warehouse processor. These tables contain information such as stored procedures and SSIS packages to
