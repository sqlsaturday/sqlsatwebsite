## Title: SQL Server Internals  Architecture
 
**Abstract**:
Let’s face it. You can effectively do many IT jobs related to SQL Server without knowing the internals of how SQL Server works. Many great developers, DBAs, and designers get their day-to-day work completed on time and with reasonable quality while never really knowing what’s happening behind the scenes. But if you want to take your skills to the next level, it’s critical to know SQL Server’s internal processes and architecture. This session will answer questions like: - What’s different about 32- and 64-bit systems? - What are the various areas of memory inside of SQL Server? - How are queries handled behind the scenes? - What does SQL Server do with procedural code, like functions, procedures, and triggers? - ...and much more.

## Title: Wish you could live the glamorous consulting life?
 
**Abstract**:
Consulting is a great career choice, from the increased pay, (sometimes less), to the flexible hours, (working nights and weekends), you will work with a wide range of customers, (if you can find them), that will lead you to wonder why you didn't start earlier? (and walk away from a cushy job).

I would not trade my consulting career for any other choice, I love the rewards and the freedom it provides me, but I've learned the hard way.
In this session you will lean sales, marketing and management strategies to get your practice off the ground, sand traps to avoid along the way and a honest, down to earth assessment of the consulting life. An essential session for those thinking about this choice and/or those who are just starting out

## Title: Taking the Scary out of Monster Reports
 
**Abstract**:
So the big wigs have come up with a “master” report that shows everything you could ever want on a single report.  It includes grids and charts of varying sizes and complexities.  Did I mention they want it pretty as well?  In this session we will discuss how to use SQL Reporting Services 2008 R2 to bring it all together while avoiding the pit falls and mistakes.  The demonstration will show how to build a multi-page, dashboard style report to manage your report server showing a multitude of grids and charts.  We will discuss the challenges with data reuse and formatting while exploring techniques for getting them to work.  To get the most out of this session, you should be able to build a report in SSRS.

## Title: Tame Your Unruly Data...With Constraints!
 
**Abstract**:
Never given time or care, never forming good relationships, becoming bloated, corrupt and rife with indistinguishable copies, and all so horrifyingly pervasive in society. But enough about the Kardashians, what about YOUR DATA? If you want to straighten it out and prevent it from going too far in the first place, this session is for you. We will cover constraint basics (not null, check, primary key/unique, foreign keys), provide standard use cases, and address misconceptions about constraint use and performance. We will also look at triggers and application logic and why these are NOT substitutes for (but can effectively complement) good constraint usage. Attendees will enjoy learning how to keep THEIR data off the tabloid page!

## Title: SQL Azure vs. Azure Tables –Clearing The Confusion
 
**Abstract**:
The Azure platform is quickly gaining momentum and acceptance, in part due to the relational database capabilities of SQL Azure as well as the inexpensive and high-capacity storage capabilities of Azure Tables. Yet, there seems to be some confusion as to why and when you would use SQL Azure vs. Azure Tables. One is relational, and one is not, yet there has been a tendency to use Azure Storage Tables as a replacement for SQL Azure, with poor results. This session will provide a deep look at the difference between SQL Azure and Azure Storage Tables, and show the performance differences when querying each. We will look at how each stores data and the pros and cons of using each as a storage mechanism, and discuss how and why you would choose.

## Title: Transitioning from SQL Trace to Extended Events
 
**Abstract**:
Extended Events were introduced with SQL Server 2008, but without a UI, which meant using T-SQL to create and manage them and using XPath and XQuery to parse the output.  Microsoft has added an Extended Events UI in SQL Server 2012 and also added additional events.  With the announcement that SQL Trace/Profiler is being deprecated now is the time to begin learning Extended Events.  This session will show you how to take existing Traces and convert them to Extended Event Sessions.

## Title: Partitioning for Perf  Management of Large Tables
 
**Abstract**:
Managing data in ever-growing transaction and history tables can be challenging. Activities with large chunks of data such as moving data to archive tables, batch-importing many rows, or defragging an entire table when only the active portion changes introduces heavy I/O and blocking. Table partitioning seamlessly solves a host of headaches with minimal effort. Ever wanted to truncate or defrag part of a table, or insert an entire staging table of data into another table in milliseconds instead of hours?  Come see what partitioning can provide for you.
