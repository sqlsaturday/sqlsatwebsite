## Title: Power View from the Data Visualisation Perspective
 
**Abstract**:
Power View is Microsoft's Data Visualisation tool. Where does it get it right, and where does it get it wrong? Using demos, we learn about Power View whilst assessing it based on current cognitive research around Data Visualisation principles by luminaries such as Stephen Few, Tufte and others. We will:

- investigate Power View based on current cognitive research around Data Visualisation principles
- look at the features of Power View
- look at where Power View is supplemented by other parts of the Microsoft Business Intelligence stack

Come to this session if you really want to think about the best ways of presenting data to your Business Intelligence data consumers, and see how to apply these principles in Power View.

## Title: Enter the Dragon: SQL 2012 on Server Core
 
**Abstract**:
In 1982 the Dragon 32 entered the home computer market but unfortunately there was one small problem ...lower-case letters were almost impossible to access. Two years later, Dragon was no more. In 2008 MS released Server Core providing a fast streamlined edition of Windows with minimal GUI support. As of SQL 2012, installation to W2008R2 Core is now a supported option and means the biggest administrative change to a DBA since the release of SQL 2005 ...or will it?

We will demonstrate OS configuration through Cmd line utils and PowerShell, SQL installation, Remote Admin and Clustering on Core. Will the lack of GUI support send Server Core in the same direction as the Dragon 32 or spell a bright new future for SQL  Windows Server computin

## Title: The Turbo-Booster in SQL 2012: Columnstore Indexes
 
**Abstract**:
Do you want to improve your DWH query performance by 100 times by just adding one additional index? Not possible? Wrong! SQL Server 2012 provides you the new Columnstore Index which changes the paradigm for DWH queries completely. In this session we will look at the details of the new Columnstore Index, when it makes sense, when not, and what are the current restrictions of it. We will look into Row Store vs. Column Store, how to change data in tables that have a Columnstore Index defined, we talk about Segment Elimination, Batch Mode Execution, about Query Memory Grants, and finally about how you can make sure that SQL Server will use your Columnstore Index as effective as possible.
