## Title: I/O Tuning 101
 
**Abstract**:
One of the most common problems I have encountered as a DBA is the complaints from users that a particular query is slow, just one query.  Many times one that used to run in acceptable time, but that over time has slowed down substantially.

In this session we will show some of the causes for this, with emphasis on I/O requests being too high for the query.  

First part of the session will explain how to find these numbers, looking at a few queries with some major performance issues, including explaining why they have a problem.

The second part will focus on how to reduce I/O requests.

All of this can be done without the need for any 3rd party tools, all within the scope of what is available to SQL Server, all versions, all editions, including Azure.

## Title: Speed Up Development and Testing Using Data Virtualization
 
**Abstract**:
Constraining everything in development and testing is database size. Storage is a bottleneck, and while faster SSD/Flash is available, it is often too costly due to the size of many databases, especially non-production. More importantly, it takes a lot of time to push terabytes around and time itself is costly. The old joke about "good, fast, and cheap -- pick any two" is very true with data.

Because providing full databases for each developer on each project seems unrealistic, for decades everyone has limited themselves to working in shared non-production environments that are refreshed only every few months at best. Conflicts occur, quality suffers.  Development is slow and fails to keep up with business needs.

Come learn why data virtualization is the solution to a problem everyone knows.

Good, fast, and cheap -- have all three with data virtualization.  Clone things easily and quickly, and remove the biggest constraint to development and testing.

## Title: Don't just code it—Generate It
 
**Abstract**:
Code Generators are all the rage—BIML, JS frameworks, .NET scaffolding, even the humble templates provide by SSMS for views, stored procedures, functions.
Table-driven applications allow one set of code to handle changing business needs. Metadata-driven code generation takes this a giant step further. If you can describe your code with an algorithm operating against a set of data, you can get a computer to produce the code.
 - Source to Target mapping documents can be used to generate the code to effect the mapping.
 - Service Broker activation stored procedures have a clearly defined structure. They can be mass-produced.
 - Standard CRUD stored procedures can be stamped out cookie-cutter fashion.
 - Business rules can be encoded in data and the code to implement them manufactured.
Generated code has systematic errors. Fix the errors at the generator. All the code now works. If the code is so boring that a computer can produce it, why not spend your talent doing something interesting?

## Title: That's So Metadata: Discover Your Database From the Inside
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever needed to learn a new database design and don't know where to begin? Or are trying to find out why a query doesn't perform well?  Or need to provide security information to auditors or your security team?

SQL Server has a number of metadata facilities available to help you with these tasks, and more. Functions, dynamic management views, and system stored procedures can illuminate details from the smallest column up through an entire SQL Server instance and everything in-between. We will demonstrate metadata techniques to help you:

- Document your database schema objects such as procedures, functions, tables, columns and indexes
- Investigate performance and look for bottlenecks
- Discover metadata to administer your databases backups, index maintenance, and security
- Apply your own metadata using extended properties

We'll also demonstrate the new SQL Data Discovery/Classification and Vulnerability Assessment features in SQL Server Management Studio.

## Title: Screw DevOps, Let's Talk DataOps
 
**Abstract**:
DevOps is the new hot topic for IT, but only answers part of the problem. This session and demo will discuss why data creates continual friction in the DevOps environment and how it must be incorporated into the solution.
Reasons for this solution is required: -Data is getting bigger and more complex -Security concerns around critical data is becoming more evident every day -Data is created in silos in many sources, yet consumed in just as many locations, including on-premises and in the cloud.

We'll discuss the tech, the politics and the challenges of bringing data into DevOps and how to do so more successfully with culture changes, tools, scripting, and virtualization.

Takeaways from this session:
1. Learn the five principles of Data Ops 2. How embracing a dynamic data platform can eliminate challenges and provide automation. 3. Learn the difference between containers, packages and data pods. 4. Learn how to bridge the gap between data and people, eliminating culture from the scene

## Title: Everything You Need to Know About SQL Server Indexes
 
**Abstract**:
You probably already know that indexes make your queries go faster. But do you know all the different types of indexes in SQL Server and when to use them? Also with each new release of SQL Server, there are new features that can impact how indexes function and are maintained. Finally, knowing how the different types of indexes work can help you make better indexing choices when tuning your queries.
This presentation will review current SQL Server index structures and options, discuss how they work, when they should be used and how to maintain them. Examples of all the index types such as hash, in-memory, columnstore, filtered, etc… will be shown.
This presentation is a must see for DBAs, Developers, Application Architects and anyone else who is interesting in maintaining high performance SQL Server applications.

## Title: Consulting/contracting - is it right for me?
 
**Abstract**:
You have probably worked as a direct hire for a company.  You get medical benefits, vacation, and possibly a good 401k.  On occasion you might have accepted a contract.  The pay might be nicer, but you are concerned because you have less job security, no vacation, and no benefits.  Yet, there are some who prefer contracts.  We will cover how to negotiate a wage, appear professional, a look at finances, contractual gottchas, taxes and paperwork.  Since most are experienced at being a direct hire with a company, this presentation will show the benefits of consulting/contracting, so that you can decide what is right for you and your career path.  Presenter has been contracting for 18 of the last 20 years and will share many of his experiences - the successes and the falls along the way.

## Title: Eyes on the Prize:  Simple and Effective Dashboard Visualization Techniques
 
**Abstract**:
When done right, data visualization informs users quickly and efficiently with a minimum of distraction.  When done wrong, we end up with spinning 3D pie charts.  In this talk, we will look at techniques for effective dashboard design, minimizing noise and clutter (like spinning 3D pie charts) while providing relevant information to the intended audience.  We will see how different types of charts work, build out rules of thumb around which charts to use, and integrate visuals to create a coherent dashboard image.  When it comes to dashboards, we will compare and contrast dashboards based on their intended uses, such as interactive dashboards versus TV dashboards.  Finally, we will take an awful dashboard and turn it into something which end users will appreciate.

## Title: A DBA's guide to full stack performance troubleshooting
 
**Abstract**:
Performance troubleshooting is a required skill for every DBA. Knowing the deep internals of how a query functions and why SQL Server chose to run it in a certain way is important. Knowing how to design a table or configure a database to squeeze every ounce of performance is our lifeblood. 

What if I told you that you may be doing this all wrong? What if all the work and laborious effort put into design or configuration don't improve the situation because the issue was never in SQL to begin with? Truth be told, the biggest differentiator between a good DBA and a great DBA is knowing the hardware and O/S; not just SQL.

Join me as I guide you through troubleshooting SQL Server performance from tip to toe to demonstrate the common performance problems you never knew you had.

## Title: The Power of Data:  The Complete Beginners Data Warehouse Kit
 
**Abstract**:
For many of us data is scattered in many different systems.  We almost all have data that someone wants to compare or track but can't without a lot of manual manipulation.  So, how do you tie disparate systems together? With a Data Warehouse! In this presentation you will get the skills you need to start building your own. We will discuss the basics of what a Data Warehouse is, the tools needed to create, deploy and manage the Data Warehouse process, and the benefits of using the data you collect to manage operational processes and create data visualizations. After attending this session you will be able to return to your job and amaze people with your ability to show them the power of the data!

## Title: Beginning Admin: The Care and Feeding of SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Design and development may be exciting, but database administration is absolutely critical (and, reasonably well-paying!) The care and feeding of a server tends to get short-changed or neglected.  In this class, we'll cover the basics of the big five administrator tasks:

* Backups – You must set up regular backups, to keep copies of your databases...just in case something breaks, or someone makes a bad, bad mistake.
* Integrity checks – Regularly and automatically check databases for corruption, which is when bits get scrambled, lost, and ruined.
* Index maintenance – Databases need regular upkeep so they'll continue to run well.
* Disk management – It's actually your job to find out about full disks before they happen. After all, databases grow!
* Alerting – Alerts tell you what's wrong, so you don't have to go looking for problems.

Being a database administrator is a big job, but we can cover the basics in one session!

## Title: SQL vs NoSQL: a Comparison of SQL vs MongoDB
 
**Abstract**:
Have you heard of NoSQL, but aren't really sure what it is? Are you wondering if you're missing out on something that could satisfy that complex data model problem you haven't found a good solution for?

We'll learn about the flavors of NoSql and then dig down into MongoDB, the NoSQL database that drives many websites. Then we'll get an overview of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) along with how and why it's used in NoSQL, focusing on its advantages and disadvantages.

You'll see how the SQL table structure compares to the NoSQL data structure. After that, we'll look at examples of storing the same data in both systems and how that data flows to the web page.

We'll discuss the factors that drive your choice of database along with the trade-offs involved. Then we'll wrap up by taking a look at Microsoft's on-premises and cloud efforts in the MongoDB NoSQL space.

## Title: The Anatomy of Select
 
**Abstract**:
TSQL is one of the most valuable tools any SQL Server professional can add to their tool-set. More aptly, TSQL is a whole chest of tools for the SQL Server professional. One of the most important tools in that TSQL chest is a good understanding of the SELECT statement.

When was the last time you sat down to evaluate a SELECT statement? What actually goes into the processing of that teeny little word? There might be a fair bit more to this simple term than just fetching data from the database. This session covers the simplicity of the select. Then we take it a step further to dive into some of the complexities tied directly to this particular statement.

This session will help the attendee better understand the Select statement. With a more solid understanding of this statement, the attendee can return and implement some of this new knowledge to help improve processing and query response times in their own environments.

## Title: Data Positioning: Self-Defense or a Brilliant New Architecture
 
**Abstract**:
The Cloud, streaming data, big data, self-service, machine learning, AI and the internet of things.  Clearly we’re not in Data Management Kansas anymore.  Data Modelers and Architects have been reacting to wave after wave of demands from these communities with new technologies and methodologies but too often remain grounded in outdated concepts of data management principles.  Data Positioning is an evolution of this thinking, allowing Data Managers to deliver value today and in the future.

## Title: Set Me Up: How to Think in Sets
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server is optimized to work in sets, but this is certainly a paradigm shift for someone accustomed to row-by-row operations.
 
We will look at T-SQL features that can break set-based processing -- generally meaning poor performance -- and gather empirical evidence to support that assertion.  We'll also look at some constructs to overcome these issues and make your T-SQL scripts run faster and use fewer resources.

## Title: inMemory OLTP for developers
 
**Abstract**:
With the significant improvements made to in-memory OLTP in SQL Server 2016, it’s natural to expect significant increases in query performance. But what do we do when queries which utilize in-memory tables actually start to perform same or, in some cases, even worse than their equivalent disk based table predecessors?  In this session, we are going to take a look at in-memory tables their best use cases as well as development best practices. We will also look at the changes to the indexing design for inMemory based objects and how it differs from existing disk based table indexing. Finally, we are going to cover how to build fast scalable applications which utilize inMemory objects as well as choosing the appropriate indexes for your inMemory objects to give you the performance boost that you have been expecting.

## Title: How to Realize  Quantify Value from Data
 
**Abstract**:
As we transition from the information age to the age of insights, data practitioners face the challenge of justifying investment of time, resources, and capital in data initiatives.  Data and analytics professionals are increasingly being asked to practice what we preach as data storytellers and answer, what value does my data have?

We will discuss how to create business cases, value statements and return on investment for data projects and programs.  We will address the approach to calculating and communicating value throughout the entire project life cycle from conception to execution to evolution with special consideration to each part of the data ecosystem including data governance, data management, data visualization, and analytics.

## Title: Master Data Management in the GDPR Era
 
**Abstract**:
Master data management (MDM) is a set of tools and processes that provide visibility into enterprise data and where it is stored and used, while also keeping it current and relevant. MDM is architected in two forms: analytical MDM and operational MDM. In this session, you will obtain a good business and technical understanding of how both types of MDM can help you achieve business clarity across the organization through a data governance strategy to help work within GDPR.

How does GDPR effect businesses inside and outside of the EU? What is required to do business with EU citizens? There are many questions to address today, and those questions necessitate a reliable and accurate overview of not only your data but of individual customers. MDM addresses this necessity and can serve as the technical basis for GDPR compliance.

## Title: COZYROC: Dynamic Data Flows in SSIS without Programming
 
**Abstract**:
This session is an introduction to the unique functionality offered by COZYROC to create integration packages that dynamically map columns at runtime. The standard SSIS Data Flow Task can only use static metadata which is defined when the package is initially designed. The mapping of columns is configured and remains unchanged until the package is re-opened and design changes are made, thus costing maintenance time and effort. Data Flow Task Plus extends the capabilities of the standard Microsoft Data Flow task in that it allows you to set up dynamic data flows, thus eliminating maintenance time and effort. Changes to tables and columns are automatically incorporated at run time without the need to change and redeploy the package. Columns and fields are mapped automatically at run time. Furthermore, the initial design time and effort may be greatly reduced when dealing with huge amounts of data in a large number of files and/or databases.

## Title: Monster Text Manipulation: Regular Expressions for the DBA
 
**Abstract**:
Regular expressions can help you perform incredible tasks with very little effort. Need to create 1700 logins from an email request? Developers give you a single script with 300 stored procedures filled with table variables instead of temp tables? Need to move 500 databases to a different drive? Any of these tasks can take a long time to code, but regular expressions cuts that work from hours to seconds. I use regular expressions all the time and I have taken many tasks down from several days to just a few minutes. Stop writing code manually and let regular expressions do it for you. 
Here you’ll learn: 
• The most useful regular expression commands. 
• The appropriate times to use regular expressions. 
• How to use regular expressions to write code for you. 
• How to incorporate regular expressions into large tasks and combine them with other methods.

## Title: Fishing for Answers: Azure Data Lake
 
**Abstract**:
Did you ever hear someone say “make your data lake your staging area for your data warehouse” or “a data lake can handle any data format” or “if I build a data lake data everyone will use it”?  Really? Are these good ideas and true statements?  Is there a design strategy that I should follow so I don’t end up with a “data swamp”? Are there tools or techniques to load data into the lake and get data out easily? Can I easily visualize my data in the lake? What about security? And finally, how does a data lake really fit into my BI landscape when I have so many infrastructure and tool options to pick from?
This session will demo putting data into a data lake, pulling data, visualizing data, and testing data lake performance.  I will evaluate the strengths, weaknesses and implementation approaches.  At the end of the session everyone should have a clear picture of what Azure Data Lake is, how to implement it, and is it a good fit for your organization.

## Title: Automate the Pain Away with Adaptive Query Processing and Automatic Tuning
 
**Abstract**:
The way you tune your SQL Server workloads are changing.  In the past, you would rely on dynamic management views, execution plan cache, and server-side traces or extend events.  In SQL Server 2012 we were introduced to Columnstore indexes; In SQL 2014 the cardinality estimator got a huge overhaul. With SQL Server 2016 we were given query store to allow us to get more insight into our performance pains and execution plan changes. SQL Server 2017 gave us Automatic Tuning and Adaptive Query Processing to help automate performance improvements. In this session, we will harness the ways you improve performance into the new so you can automate the pain away and spend more time identifying and tuning pain points that cannot be automated.

## Title: The Life Cycle of a Query in Virtual Reality
 
**Abstract**:
Every day around the world, billions and billions of queries are run using SQL Server. By understanding how queries are run will provide a greater insight into learning how both the relational and storage engines work for better performance and troubleshooting.

This presentation has taken the concept of a flow chart and a mind palace and turned it into a virtual reality (VR) experience. The ability to become immersed and walk around inside of a VR environment is a new and unique way to present and look at information. As data professionals we need to be open to novel displays of technical information and explore what VR can do that for us that we have not been able to do in the past. 

The Life Cycle of a Query in Virtual Reality is built using a video game engine from Epic Games called Unreal Engine 4 (UE4).

## Title: Power BI, from a DBA's Perspective
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft’s Power BI is the new hotness. In this session, you will get your hands dirty and dive into PowerBI and create an actual report, with actual data. You will get to learn from examples from what a DBA has done to implement Power BI in his shop and make his data accessible.

As a DBA, we often need to collect and display data in a friendly and interactive fashion. We will play with some PowerShell to collect data from several systems, store this data in an Azure DB in the Cloud, then point Power BI at this data to display and interact with said data. You will learn a little about PowerShell, Azure SQL DB, Power BI, and how to make these work for you.

## Title: It's Time for a Change: Temporal Table Support in SQL Server 2016/17
 
**Abstract**:
Without temporal tables (AKA history tables), we can only see the current version of data. We can’t see rows that have been deleted or rows as they existed before the latest update. The temporal table support in SQL Server 2016 gives us the ability to create system-maintained “history” tables to track all changes to the table data.

In this session we’ll discuss how you can benefit from temporal support in your tables, how to implement temporal tables in SQL Server 2016, and how to write “time travel queries” using the new FOR SYSTEM_TIME clause in a SELECT statement to easily query historical information.

## Title: Understanding and Handling Database Corruption
 
**Abstract**:
Database corruption is simply a fact of a DBA's life - if you haven't seen it yet, you will. Success or failure depends on having a solid plan to deal with different types of corruption. In this session, we will discuss usage of related DBCC commands such as DBINFO, CHECKDB and PAGE. You'll learn how to monitor for corruption with SQL Agent Alerts and Jobs, and when it's time to restore instead of repair. After attending this session, you will be able to check for issues such as page corruption or data purity problems, and take the appropriate measures to deal with them.

## Title: Database best practices for applications
 
**Abstract**:
Whether you’re an experienced application developer or seasoned database administrator application databases can be, unexpectedly, tricky even when they shouldn’t. SPA, MVC, and form applications can all benefit from a well architected and tuned database.

## Title: That's bad mkay!
 
**Abstract**:
We've all heard that things like nested views, cursors, and under/over-indexed tables are bad...but why?  What is the real cost of the badness that abounds in the database world?  What's really going on when you run that query against a view of a view of a view.  How can you quantify what happens when that cursor ends up running the same simple query thousands of times.  And how can indexes really impact the way SQL Server decides to solve your queries.  In this session we'll talk about the basics of how to read query plans and use extended events to understand why all these things can be big resource drains on a SQL Server.  Good times should be had by all.

## Title: Busy is a Four-Letter Word
 
**Abstract**:
If I ask you, "How are you?", is your default answer, "I'm so busy!"? Why do we measure our worth by how much we are doing, rather than by the value of what we do?  Are we busy doing the truly important things that will bring lasting happiness? What does this have to do with a technical conference?
