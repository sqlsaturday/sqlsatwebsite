## Title: Service Broker - Put Me In Coach
 
**Abstract**:
This session is an introduction to Service Broker basics and how you can use it to for an alternative to ETL, batch processing and other asynchronous operations. Service Broker allows you to process your data asynchronously in a single instance. It makes for  a near real time ETL process. 

We will start off with the basic components of Service Broker. Then use what we have learned to  configure it to process some real life data using American Football Plays on a single database deployment. In addition, we will then use Service Broker as a replication alternative to show the ETL capabilities using databases on two separate instances.

At the end of this session, you will have the knowledge to use Service Broker for batch processing, ETL or even an alternative to replication.

## Title: IO Tuning 101
 
**Abstract**:
One of the most common problems I have encountered as a DBA is the complaints from users that a particular query is slow, just one query.  Many times one that used to run in acceptable time, but now has slowed down substantially.

In this session we will show some of the causes for this, with emphasis on I/O requests being too high for the query.  

First part of the session will explain how to find these numbers, looking at a few queries with some major performance issues, including explaining why they have a problem.

The second part will focus on how to reduce I/O requests.

All of t his can be done without the need for any 3rd party tools, all within the scope of what is available to SQL Server, all versions, all editions, including Azure.

## Title: Performance Tuning - Analyzing Execution Plans
 
**Abstract**:
Did you ever get woken up at night from a call from a user screaming about poor query performance, but didn’t really know how to begin attack the problem?  In this session, we will explore the basics of execution plan analysis and how to single out issues that pertain to base table operations.
In this presentation, we will identify what indexes are being used by the SQL Optimizer, the different type of index operations that are performed by SQL Server and which operations are generally considered the preferred method of data retrieval. We will discuss how to determine if the indexes used by the Optimizer are optimal, according to best practices, and the exceptions to those cases.   Finally, we will cover the relationships between different types of index operations and joins within SQL Server, including how the SQL Optimizer determines which join type it will use, along with the pros and cons of each join operation

## Title: 20 Minute Tabular Model
 
**Abstract**:
Are you familiar w/ SSAS Multidimensional and curious about Tabular? Having trouble deciding between cubes and tabular models? Then this is your session!

Analysis Services Tabular was introduced back in 2012, and yet it has only just started to emerge from the Proof-Of-Concept phase to a legitimate production alternative in most IT departments. Based on xVelocity, a highly compressed in-memory technology, Tabular models provide considerable performance improvements over Multidimensional models in many scenarios. And with major advancements in 2016, Tabular has never been a more appealing solution. But, as is the case with any new technology, there are certain limitations of which to be aware. 

Join me in this session and learn what a Tabular model is, how it fits into the Microsoft BI stack, the major factors to consider when choosing between Tabular and Multidimensional technologies, and finally a live step-by-step demo where we'll build and deploy a Tabular model.

## Title: SQL Server 2016 "Hidden Gems"
 
**Abstract**:
By far the most important SQL Server release since the heady days of 2005, SQL Server 2016 represents a huge leap forward in a number of key areas. You've no doubt heard plenty about such features as Query Store, JSON support, Polybase, and the other big-ticket items. But there are also a number of very cool features that don't usually make the top 10 lists. In this talk you'll learn about enhancements to indexing (including both Columnstore and traditional b-tree indexes), DMVs, compression, string handling, encryption, configuration, and even timezone support. These smaller features may not be highlighted in the latest glossy ads from Microsoft's marketing department, but they're the kinds of things that add up to make your life easier. Attend this session to learn all sorts of new and different reasons to upgrade as quickly as possible.

## Title: Analysis Services: Show Me Where It Hurts
 
**Abstract**:
"It's Slow!" are probably the two most dreaded words for any database professional (right behind "You're fired!") 

What's slow? Since when? Compared to what?

Join me in this "something-everyone-should-be-doing-but-isn't" session, where we will discuss baselines and performance monitoring for your SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) environment. We'll cover what a baseline is, what information it needs to include, and how it can help you troubleshoot immediate problems and proactively avoid them in the future. Walk away from the session with a plan that you can implemented next week to help avoid being caught off guard by SSAS performance issues and to make troubleshooting a breeze.

## Title: Biml and SSIS Frameworks
 
**Abstract**:
You’ve probably heard that it’s a data integration best practice to build small, unit-of-work SSIS packages. You’ve heard that with Biml you can create a lot of SSIS packages in very little time. You follow this advice and end up with dozens of SSIS packages. Now what? A metadata-driven SSIS Execution Framework will simplify the execution of several SSIS packages down to a simple, one-line stored procedure call. But then, how does one manage all the metadata required to populate the SSIS Execution Framework? Biml to the rescue!
