## Title: Keeping up with SSMS
 
**Abstract**:
Starting with SQL Server 2016, SSMS became a stand-alone product.  Updates are sent out a lot more frequently than in the past and it can sometimes be difficult to keep up with all of the changes and new features.  There were 7 new version releases in 2017 and 8 new version releases in 2018.  With all of the new releases, are you using SQL Server Management Studio to its fullest?  We will discuss some of the features available in the SSMS v17 and v18.

On top of the new versions, there is a lot of cool stuff available in SSMS that you may not be aware is there.  We will discuss and demonstrate some features offered in SSMS that will help make Developers and Database Administrators more productive (and everyone wants to be more productive).  Whether a DBA or a Developer, you will take away knowledge about the new SSMS versions along with some useful SSMS tips/tricks to use in SSMS that you can apply in your day to day activities.

## Title: “Black Arts” Index Maintenance #2: Better Methods that Can Actually Prevent Fragmentation for Weeks.
 
**Abstract**:
Most people don’t realize it but the current “Best Practice” Methods are actually a leading cause of perpetual logical and physical fragmentation, totally unnecessary wasted memory, costly and continuous “Bad” page splits, unexplainable blocking, comparatively insane amounts of log file generation and, in an interesting “Catch 22”, a major part of why we have to do so much index maintenance.

This isn’t your typical presentation on Index Maintenance.

In this second of two back-to-back sessions, we’ll learn of several incredibly easy modifications to your Index Maintenance routines to actually prevent fragmentation for weeks rather than perpetuating it,  virtually eliminate “Bad” page splits, reduce wasted memory, make your log file  log file backups a whole lot more happy and increase the overall performance of even perfect code.

We’ll also learn that no simple method is a panacea, what to do about the horror of "expAnsive" updates, and how to make even GUID-keyed indexes work well.

## Title: “Black Arts” Index Maintenance #1: How the “Best Practice” Methods are Silently Killing Performance
 
**Abstract**:
Most people don’t realize it but the current “Best Practice” Methods are actually a leading cause of perpetual logical and physical fragmentation, totally unnecessary wasted memory, costly and continuous “Bad” page splits, unexplainable blocking, comparatively insane amounts of log file generation and, in an interesting “Catch 22”, a major part of why we have to do so much index maintenance.

This isn’t your typical presentation on Index Maintenance.

In this first of two back-to-back sessions on the subject, we’ll explore what happens to an index in the first year of its life for four different common Fill Factors along with how “Best Practice” methods executed once per week and once per day have their way with you, your indexes, your log files, wasted memory, and the performance of your code even if it’s perfect code.

## Title: Introduction to the R Programming Language for BI Professionals
 
**Abstract**:
The modern BI professional is taking on the challenge of operationalizing data science. Most BI developers are very strong in TSQL but their exposer to advanced statistics and visualizations were limited by what is available in the TSQL language. The R programming language allows us to clean, visualize, and apply advanced statistical methods to data. 

In this session I will demonstrate how to use R Studio to generate and test R scripts; generate R visuals in PowerBI; call R code in machine learning workflows; and execute R code in SQL Server. Additionally, I will cover these R programming fundamentals: creating and assigning variables; performing simple calculations; understanding R data types; vectors; matrices; factors; lists; data frames; and ggplot2 graphics.

## Title: The very Model of a Modern Day Database
 
**Abstract**:
Gilbert and Sullivan never had to create a database. But you do. This session will delve into details of the system databases.
These are created when the system is installed and then DBAs pretty much forget about them.  If you ask, they might have an idea of what their use is, but the truth is, they're sort of a black box to many.

This session will cover how and when to back them up, how to move them if necessary and how to take advantage of that "model" database that seems to just sort of sit there.
