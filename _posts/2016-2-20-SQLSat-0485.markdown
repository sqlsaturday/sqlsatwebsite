## Title: Security enhancements in SQL Server 2016
 
**Abstract**:
There are several pretty cool enhancements regarding security in SQL Server 2016.

This session will cover some of them in the following (new) topics:

- Always Encrypted: 
  Worried about having your sensitive data stored in a cloud managed database? This feature can help you, allowing to ensure that your cloud provider can't look at your sensitive data, since it remains encrypted for him, but not for you :-) 

- Dynamic Data Masking: 
  By using this feature you can control how does your confidential data appear to those that shouldn't have entire access to it. For instance they should only be able to see the first 3 digits of a phone number...   

- Row Level Security: 
  Row-Level Security enables us to control access to rows in a database table based on the characteristics of the user executing a query. 


Join me in a set of full demonstrations for all these features!
