## Title: Introducing Cube World To Users From Flat Table Land
 
**Abstract**:
This session explores the tabular approach to building cubes in SQL Server Analysis Services 2012 for those DBAs and developers who are more comfortable working with relational databases than cubes. Starting with a ‘normal’ relational database, the attendee will learn how to build a basic model by loading data from several data sources, establish relations between these data sources, define measures and dimensions, build hierarchies, create KPIs and deploy functional cubes that can be used to answer management’s questions about what is really going on with their data. For users already familiar with PowerPivot, this session provides a good transition into the world of SSAS as both use essentially the same techniques.

## Title: Design and Implement BI like Edison! 
 
**Abstract**:
As the most prolific inventor in American history, Thomas Edison was a master of “Best Practices!” Edison’s creations were not just novel and commercially successful, but many launched entire new industries including electric light and power, sound recording, motion pictures and industrial cement and concrete manufacture. At the heart of Edison’s remarkable record of innovation was his categorization of the innovation process into “competencies,” or bundles of skills supporting the achievement of success in a particular area of endeavor.  In this session, we will look at ways that we can use many of these broad success secrets to bring powerful tools and strategies to the recurring implementation of business intelligence.

## Title: Forget "Big Data" ! How About "Smart Data" Instead?
 
**Abstract**:
There’s no denying that Big Data is here to stay, and that society will ultimately be transformed in many ways as a result of its impact. But while Big Data might be 'the next big thing', most companies, no matter what size, would probably do better to focus first on fully utilizing non-big-data BI to address the core challenges of any company, which include: leadership, management, and motivation. In this presentation, I’ll be reviewing three uses of "traditional BI" that are often under-employed and which can be transformational for a business in their own right. For this, I'll be sharing examples, practical tips, and stories from my own experiences at my organization, coupon-giant Valpak.

## Title: Heterogeneous Data Environments
 
**Abstract**:
Analyzing data across multiple sources for a 360 degree view of your business
 
Not only is the size of data growing, but so are the number of data sources and the number of requests from the business to analyze it. Today’s data professionals are now required to access a myriad of relational and non-relational sources, mash it up together and provide in-depth reports and visualizations, and usually without a lot of time. In this session, product evangelist Peter Evans will show you how Toad can dramatically reduce time spent on accessing relational and non-relational data, simplify data integration, and how to collaborate with other users for a 360 degree view of your business.

This session provides examples of powerfully combining data from lots of different sources in creative ways that were simply not possible in the past.  This session will walk you through real life scenarios, using these tools to fill in missing and move from “if only” to “what if”, and valuable insight...

## Title: Handling Errors and Data Anomalies in SSIS
 
**Abstract**:
Even in the most reliable ETL system, it's eventually going to happen: A package will fail, an output row count won't match what is expected, a data anomaly will force a forensic search of the package infrastructure... In this session, we'll talk about some of the things that can go wrong during package execution - and some of the defenses that can be built into SSIS to help head off those errors (or at least make the errors easier to troubleshoot). From error handlers to package restartability, and from logging methods to row count validation and remediation, we'll cover various ways to keep your ETL flowing when problems arise.
