## Title: Loading the Windows Azure Cloud 
 
**Abstract**:
Windows Azure provides many options for storing data. SQL Azure is one of Windows Azure’s solutions for working with relational data. If you are familiar with SQL Server, SQL Azure will be a natural extension of your knowledge and skills. 
In this session, we will look at the different options for loading data to the Cloud from an on premise SQL server and vice versa. Topics we will cover include: 
1)	SQL Azure Data Sync - Migrate data from an existing on-premise SQL Server database to SQL Azure and bi-directional data synchronization and data management capabilities allowing data to be easily shared across SQL Azure databases across multiple data centers.  
2)	 BACPAC – Importing and Exporting the BACPAC
3)	CDC  - loading the Data to cloud by capturing the incremental Changes at ON-Premise (SSIS)
4)	Finally, we will query the System Views for the data movement.
What you will learn:
•	Overview of SQL Azure
•	SQL Azure Data Sync
•	BACPAC
•	Incremental Load to Cloud

## Title: Pivoting Performance Data  Pinpointing Problems
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever been wrought with end user complaints of database performance issues only to open your tools that show only live performance or limited historical performance and find no answers? After being bit by this many times, I developed my own eye in the sky to monitor CPU  Physical IO at the database, user and application levels. This solution logs data continuously and parses it into an Analysis Services cube which can be queried by Excel. No need to requisition funds for 3rd party tools. You can do this with the tools you have and I’ll give you the scripts to get started. Using these tools I have been able to find needles in haystacks and effectively communicate the nature of the problems to people at all levels.

## Title: From Minutes to Milliseconds: High-Performance SSRS Tuning
 
**Abstract**:
Even though you're an experienced report developer or administrator, performance tuning for SQL Server Reporting Services still feels as bewildering and hopeless as folding a fitted bed sheet. You've made your data sets smaller and timeouts longer, but it's not enough to remove the slowness dragging down your reporting environment.

In this session, you'll learn how design and configuration choices put pressure on your report server and techniques to relieve that pressure. You’ll see how to configure your Reporting Services databases for speed, houseclean your subscription schedules, and use caching for high-demand reports. You'll also learn some design strategies to lighten your report processing load. If you want to maximize the speed of your Reporting Services environment and minimize the pain of performance tuning, this session is for you.

## Title: (SQL,SSIS,MDS) Adv Fuzzy Matching Roll Your Own
 
**Abstract**:
Fuzzy Matching, Similarity Matching or Record Linkage is the most critical and least understood process in any Data Warehouse, BI, Integration, Big Data , Data Quality, MDM , Social Network or integrating crap effort. Over at LinkedIn there is Group run by Henrik Liliendahl Sorensen for Data Matching, Bill Winkler, principal researcher at the US Census" has written a series of white papers on record linkage and particular a technique called "Blocking Indexs". In addition we wil cover William Cohen Research Professor, Machine Learning Department, Carnegie Mellon University white papers an implementations. Presented will be our collection of "real world" examples(Code) and you will leave a master of record linkage and the concepts behind it

## Title: Don’t Miss Out on Excel Cube Functions
 
**Abstract**:
Cube functions have existed since Excel 2007, but they’re not as well known nor as well publicized as other methods to obtain data from Analysis Services/PowerPivot sources. Business Analysts may feel confined to tabular (symmetrical) reports with pivot tables. BI Developers may avoid Excel because they want the ability to write calculations in MDX and the extensive formatting capabilities of Reporting Services. And Power View limits you to the sets, calculations, and captions available in the data source and doesn’t provide drillthrough detail. We’ll start with the basics of how to write and use cube functions, then employ them to build a nicely formatted, asymmetrical, parameter-driven report that overcomes the previously noted limitation

## Title: Proactively+Automagically Manage your SQL footprin
 
**Abstract**:
As a DBA I think it's essential to stay proactive and ahead of the game.  Using SSIS, SSRS, and a little bit of creativity I cut down the amount of time spent firefighting and come to meetings with quantitative answers for questions like:

1.  How can we do Capacity Planning based on actual data growth trends?
2.  How many databases out there have missing indexes, and what are the indexes?
3.  Are you 100% certain your databases are backed up, even if you haven't seen any failure alerts come through?
4.  Developers' application logs report that SQL sessions were timing out a couple days ago.  What was going on in SQL at that time?
5.  What databases are set to Autogrow in too small of increments (and/or growing too frequently)?

## Title: What SQL DBAs need to know about SharePoint
 
**Abstract**:
With the number of deployments of SharePoint exponentially growing every day, as a DBA, it is very likely you are going to have SharePoint databases on SQL Servers you support. This session reviews SharePoint strictly from the SQL Server perspective. You will learn how SharePoint is optimized for SQL, how to properly manage and maintain the SharePoint databases, how to optimize the SQL configuration for SharePoint,  what settings in SharePoint need to be changed or not changed to maintain SQL Server performance, supported methods for providing high availability and disaster recovery, and the part SharePoint and SQL each play in the Microsoft Business Intelligence story.

## Title: Capture Change and Apply it With Change Data Capture  SSIS
 
**Abstract**:
Whether you are trying to setup a new data warehouse, keep it updated, audit changes to your databases or quickly load changes to another database Change Data Capture (CDC) is a solution for all of these and can now be setup and supported easily with SQL Server  SSIS 2012! Change Data Capture (CDC) has been around since SQL Server 2008, but has been underused because it was difficult to fully implement. SSIS 2012 now provides support for CDC with new components that make consuming the captured data very easy to apply. This session will define what CDC is and with live demos show how it is setup on your databases. Once it has been setup then you need to consume and apply those changes, this will be demonstrated with live demos using SSIS 2012 to create packages that apply the changes.

## Title: Getting Started with Execution Plans
 
**Abstract**:
You just received a phone call from your boss telling you that a certain web page or report is timing out and your users are furious. You need to quickly diagnose what the problem is. Where do you turn to first? When a query is underperforming, hogging resources or timing out, the first thing you want to examine is the query execution plan. An execution plan provides a wealth of information that can help you quickly diagnose what is wrong. In this beginner level session you will learn what an execution plan is, how to find it, and how to interpret it to see what the query optimizer is doing and find the major pain points

## Title: Yesterday I Couldn’t Even Spell ‘DBA’.
 
**Abstract**:
Referred to as “DBA by Default” or “Reluctant DBA”, many people are faced with the situation of suddenly becoming a SQL Server database administrator.  Once the initial shock passes they realize that they need help. The abundance of SQL Server books and websites that exist, some good and some not so good, might only increase confusion leading to panic and rash decisions. DON’T PANIC! In this session we will cover ways to address basic problems and offer some suggestions for finding good places to find help.

## Title: XQuery Basics for the DBA
 
**Abstract**:
For the past few years, XML has been making its way more and more into our SQL Server instances. For a moment let’s forget that developers often find the need to store XML data in their databases. Outside of those databases, XML has already invaded our SQL Servers. It’s made its way into execution plans with the SHOWPLAN XML. It’s telling us about deadlock through deadlock graphs. It’s also presented to us through service broke, event notifications, and extended events. XML is there and we need to learn how to query it. In this session, we’ll explore some of the basic methods for querying XML through XQuery. By the end of the session you’ll be equipped with the tools and understanding needed to ease yourself into XQuery.

## Title: The Hierarchy of Monitoring Needs: A Methodology
 
**Abstract**:
When it comes to the servers in your environment, do you feel alone, afraid, and in the dark ?  If we want to know if our servers are healthy, where do we start?  It's very easy to feel lost or overwhelmed when you have hundreds, if not thousands, of metrics you can monitor in SQL Server.  The Hierarchy of Monitoring Needs provides a clear roadmap for designing your monitoring strategy.  This session will review monitoring from a high level, helping you develop a plan from the ground up by addressing critical metrics, business needs, and your overall strategic goals.

## Title: Beginning Powershell for DBAs 1.0
 
**Abstract**:
The time has come where DBAs can no longer afford to ignore powershell. Not only has it become an integral part of SQL Server, but we’re being asked to do things on a much grander scale than ever before; things that can only be done with powershell. This session will take you from nothing and explain what powershell is all about. I’m going to show you how the more things change the more they stay the same and if you master the basics of powershell in this session, you’ll be able to work with powershell not only in SQL Server, but also at the file system level, in Exchange, IIS, Windows, and anything else. So in this session I’m going to show you the basics you need to get your powershell career started.

## Title: What Are You Waiting For?
 
**Abstract**:
You’ve spent the afternoon sweating over your T-SQL query. You’ve wrung out all of the wrinkles. It’s deployed, it’s running… now its waiting. In SQL Server the most performant query can become a problem query if there aren’t any resources in the SQL Server for it to use. In this session, we’ll look at wait statistics and what they are. We’ll look into how they are accumulated and how they can be monitored. By the end of the session, you’ll be equipped with the tools needed to determine if there are resource issues in your environment and methods to start mitigating them.

## Title: Introduction to Execution Plans
 
**Abstract**:
Ever wonder what happens when a query is processed? Got a process that is running slow at the office and your boss in looking at you for answers? Want to look like a hero to your boss for fixing something that no one else could figure out? Then you might want to consider this session. Execution plans tell you what steps were taken to generate the results sets you did. In analyzing these plans, you can figure out what you are doing that is not efficient, so you can fix it. This session will give you the foundation you will need to do analysis so you can write better code and help your company with their performance issues.

## Title: Introduction to BIML and BIMLScript
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft has provided some great tools for creating and editing SSIS packages.  First Business Intelligence Development Studio (BIDS) then SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT).  However, when creating an SSIS package you frequently repeat the same steps over and over.  BIML is an XML markup language designed for representing the structure of an SSIS package.  BIML Script takes that structure and generates an SSIS package.In this session we will use BIDS Helper to create a simple SSIS package using BIML.  We will handle a couple SSIS scenarios with BIML and BIML Script.
