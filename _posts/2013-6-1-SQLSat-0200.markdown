## Title: Is the Job of a DBA, just a DBA?
 
**Abstract**:
As I enter into the World of Database Administration I found that I was not only concerned about the data within the Database but with other technologies that support the database. Where is the data stored and who is responsible for that device? How will that be accessed and what level of access should they be granted. What host will the Instance be installed and who is responsible for that?
These question lead to other question that we don’t have control so therefore we must find a way too intelligently and effectively communicate.  

Let’s look at some of the ways to enhance the communication between administrative groups outside of the Database realm.
Is the Operating System and Network that supports the database functioning as expected?
Is the storage device providing us with optimal throughput?
Do we have enough space to continue to grow our data and Log files?
How can this be evaluated and effectively communicated to administrators that are not DBA’s?

## Title: Analysis Services - Multidimensional vs. PowerPivot vs. Tabular/BISM
 
**Abstract**:
Remember the days when Analysis Services solely represented an OLAP engine?  Are you unclear about when to still build cubes vs. invoke the new Tabular engine in SSAS?  Do you feel confused about where the self-service capabilities of PowerPivot end and where enterprise BI begins?  If you answered YES to any of those questions, please join A.J. Mee (Principal BI Specialist at Microsoft) for some practical, real-world guidance around the three modes of SQL Server Analysis Services.  As with most of A.J.'s presentations, the vast majority of the time will be spent providing demonstrations of the technology.  Both traditional (i.e. relational) and non-traditional (i.e. unstructured/semi-structured) data sources may be incorporated into the demonstrations.

## Title: Awesome coaching questions every geek, analyst, leader, and consultant must know.
 
**Abstract**:
Coaching might be the most important and least understood component of building a high performance team and a high performance career.  Coaching leverages the art and science of active listening, powerful questions, giving and receiving high quality feedback, goal setting, and managing accountability. It’s a very different from training or mentoring. 
You spend time tuning your database.  How much time do you spend tuning questions?
This session is an introduction to the art and science of asking great coaching questions. We’ll explore a wide range of questions that are great to have in your quiver of question especially no matter what job you have in #sqlfamily.
Coaching takes years to master.  Learning basic coaching skills can happen quickly impacting your life, career, and the people around you in a modest period of time. You’ll leave this session with practical skills that can be quickly embraced and which have the potential to change your life and career for the better.

## Title: Can you Restore Back to Yesterday?  Always Answer YES!
 
**Abstract**:
As every DBA knows, the one question you want to be able to answer affirmatively is “Can you recover that data?”  

Monitoring is critical, but monitoring methods can be imperfect.  Traditional methods are difficult to set up and maintain across your entire environment, resulting in incomplete monitoring and missed alerts, so that it’s difficult to be sure of your answer to that all important question. 

This presentation will:

•	Describe a better way to monitor your database environment that is more efficient, easier to maintain, and guarantees that you never miss an alert.

•	Share key syntax, so that you are certain the databases you are responsible for are always up, always backed up, and never run out of disk/file space.

So that your answer to that all important question is always YES!

## Title: Easy Database Refactoring with SQL Server Database
 
**Abstract**:
Database development can be a daunting task when modifying many objects for a project or coordinating schema changes across a team of developers.  Implementing those changes can be equally problematic, particularly when deploying them to different versions of the same database.  SSDT makes database refactoring a breeze – tracking renamed objects, preventing data loss during deployment and maintaining references between objects in a database.  See the latest features in SSDT and learn how to create and work within a database project.  Learn the tips and tricks in Visual Studio that will cut your development effort and allow you to deploy 100s of changes without missing an object, with better quality code.

## Title: Table Vars  Temp Tables - What you NEED to Know!
 
**Abstract**:
Almost every SQL Developer is familiar with Table Variables and Temporary Tables. While each of these objects represent temporary storage, there are also substantial differences between them. Understanding the differences between Table Variables and Temporary Tables, and the ramifications that those differences cause, is essential to being able to properly select the appropriate object for use in your development tasks. In this code filled session, we’ll discover the differences and similarities of Temporary Tables and Table Variables, dispel some widespread myths about each, and answer the most important questions of them all, "When do I use one or the other and what are the various impacts of doing so?"

## Title: Automate SSIS Development for Loading a Data Warehouse
 
**Abstract**:
SSIS is the tool of choice for loading a data warehouse. But let's face it, dragging round cornered boxes and connecting them with arrows ain't fun. It's time consuming and you'll soon realize you're doing the same thing over and over again. Sam Vanga demonstrates how to dynamically create SSIS packages to process dimension and fact tables using Business Intelligence Markup Language (BIML), a free add-in.

## Title: What the VLF? 
 
**Abstract**:
Experienced DBAs know that SQL Server stores data in data files and transaction log files. What is less commonly known is that the transaction log file is broken up into smaller segments known as Virtual Log Files, or VLFs. 

Having too many VLFs will cause performance to suffer. And having too few will cause backup performance to suffer. How do you strike the right balance?

In this more advanced session, veteran DBA Mike Hillwig will show you what VLFs are, how they're created, how to identify them, and how to strike the right balance between too few and too many.

## Title: AlwaysOn - Finally, A usable 'mirror'!
 
**Abstract**:
In the past, High Availability and Disaster Recovery (HADR) had many limitations. Clustering and Mirroring are great, but the mirror/secondary database is not very usable since it is not online.  Finally, AlwaysOn solves this limitation by merging both multi-node Clustering and mirroring. AlwaysOn also allows the secondary database to remain ONLINE, so we can use it for reporting purposes without resorting to a Snapshot!  Come see this lively session with extensive demos of setting up, configuring and testing AlwaysOn. We'll also test automatic fail-over using a real web app to see how well this feature works.

## Title: An Introduction to SQL Server Virtualisation
 
**Abstract**:
Virtualisation is a hot topic at the moment and the chances are your business is probably looking at or already implemented virtualisation to some degree. As a DBA there will be pressure for you to virtualise your SQL Servers too.  Many DBAs are reluctant to virtualise their SQL servers usually because of the fear that that performance will suffer. If virtualisation is done properly though SQL Server will run perfectly well on a virtual platform and you may even get some added HA benefits thrown in for free.

## Title: “Indexing” Encrypted Data
 
**Abstract**:
As a SQL Server DBA I see my role having 2 main focuses. First is to protect the data and second is to ensure performance is maximized. More often than not companies forget about data security when they focus on performance tuning. In this presentation I will mention a few cases where encryption could have saved a lot of hassle. I will then demo a method that can be used to "index" commonly searched on encrypted values (ex: SSNs, Credit Card, etc) helping reduce the impact on the performance of a query.

## Title: Partitioning for Perf and Mgmt of Large Tables
 
**Abstract**:
Managing data in ever-growing transaction and history tables can be challenging. Activities with large chunks of data such as moving data to archive tables, batch-importing many rows, or defragging an entire table when only the active portion changes introduces heavy I/O and blocking. Table partitioning solves a host of headaches with minimal effort. Ever wanted to truncate or defrag part of a table, or insert an entire staging table of data into another table in milliseconds instead of hours?  Come see what partitioning can provide for you.

**Todd  Phillippe**
 
Is the Job of a DBA, just a DBA?
As I enter into the World of Database Administration I found that I was not only concerned about the data within the Database but with other technologies that support the database. Where is the data stored and who is responsible for that device? How will that be accessed and what level of access should they be granted. What host will the Instance be installed and who is responsible for that?
