## Title: Introducing Microsoft's EDIM Products
 
**Abstract**:
Starting in the SQL Server Denali release, data takes on a new life in the business intelligence world.  Often forgotten, data management needs to be an integral part of your reporting systems.  Learn how Microsoft has made your life easier by incorporating external parameters, environments, and groupings into Integration Services.  They have also included impact analysis and data lineage, which can be tied to tables and SSIS packages.  Two additional newcomer products, data quality services and master data services, complete the quartet.  This session will use the first Community Technical Preview of SQL Server Denali to describe and demonstrate the enhancements to the four products that make up EDIM.

## Title: ORM's and the ugly truth
 
**Abstract**:
In this session, we are going to take a surgical approach to why I as a DBA fear ugly ORM's. Even though you can use views and stored procs as plastic surgery for an ugly case of ORM, there is only so much you can do if it is ugly on the inside. Slides generally bore me, so we will only be looking at a couple before we put on our scrubs and hit the OR(M) to perform an uglyectomy to create an ORM we can live with.

Technologies: I'll be using Entity Framework 4, Linq, MVC2 and a variety of virtual surgical tools.
I ranked this session as beginner with regards to the topic of ORM's. My session makes assumptions you know about execution plans, traces, the optimizer and other non-beginner topics in SQL Server.

## Title: Parallel Data Warehouse - Architecture Overview
 
**Abstract**:
In Nov.2010, Microsoft officially released SQL Server 2008 R2 PDW Edition. Parallel Data Warehouse is a true MPP (massive parallel processing) platform featuring an ultra shared nothing architecture.  PDW is capable of delivering very fast query performance and can house up to 500 TB of data.
This session will overview both the HW and SW architecture of the PDW appliance.  It will explain how Microsoft and HP have engineered a solution using commodity HW and SW that can compete with more expensive platforms like TeraData and ExaData.  Additionally, SQL DBAs will see where their current skillset is applicable to managing a PDW appliance.
