## Title: Data Architecture – a “Corner Stone” of EA
 
**Abstract**:
Data Architecture – a “Corner Stone” of Enterprise Architecture -As the organizations across the globe, aggressively pursues their strategic objectives; a key strategy and method is required in this pursuit, and that is ‘Data/Information Availability’. Accurate, reliable and available information enables the organization to make timely and better business decisions. 

We have seen many differing methodologies over the years with CRM, Portals, B2B efforts and score carding capabilities. The need for well structured and quality information is more important than ever. As a result, we are seeing a significant acceptance and synergy relative to the importance and value having a robust Data Architecture.

Most organizations today have a co

## Title: Data Mining with Analysis Services
 
**Abstract**:
Modern day computing power along with SQL Server makes it possible to add sophisticated data mining models to our applications that forecast and predict, perform anomaly detection, and classify data.  This presentation will demonstrate how to use Analysis Services to incorporate these complex algorithms seamlessly into your databases, from transactional processing to integration, data analysis and performance management.  Attendees will be shown how to create a data mining model using SSAS, how to use SSIS to query and load mining forecasts, and a sample application that seamlessly uses the mining model.   Take a step forward towards making BI pervasive in your organization by integrating data mining into your company’s applications.

## Title: The Data Warehouse: Your BI Foundation
 
**Abstract**:
Many DBAs are thrust into a data warehouse project with little training and no experience, or they are forced to take over the existing Data Warehouse.  Designing or fixing a Data Warehouse model that supports the full range of BI functions can be a challenge for the OLTP DBA.  This session will reveal the essential components that you should put in place for a successful implementation, including concepts such as the Importance of Transformation, Redundancy and why Reuse can be Detrimental, and one of his favorite topics, Ease of Query.  Additionally, the significance of Integration, Metadata, and Governance towards creating a rock-solid, sometimes brilliant, foundation for your Business Intelligence Data Architecture will be presented.

## Title: Deep Dive on Integration Services
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Integration Services is Microsoft’s Extract Transform Load/Data Integration (ETL/DI) tool, replacing DTS.  SSIS is a very powerful and complex tool that can read data in from virtually any source, transform and mash that data however you like, then send it out to virtually any type of destination.  Understand how SSIS can be used to do just that – from the basics.  Find out how to get started using SSIS, hear what it’s really good at, and figure out what things you need a hacker’s spirit to accomplish with it.  This session is demo heavy; Tasks, expressions, precedence constraints, text files, Excel, SQL, data type conversions, performance, scripts, configurations, scheduling, and more will be covered with examples.

## Title: Business Intelligence and Data Warehousing Primer
 
**Abstract**:
Your CIO's top priority in 2010 is probably Business Intelligence. If you don't know what BI is, or are trying to deliver it directly from your OLTP database, you need to find out what you're getting into.  BI is all about helping your business users make better decisions, faster. Find out what it will take to deliver what your CIO is asking for.
BI from your OLTP database has problems - it requires technical knowledge of your data model, compromises your line of business application responsiveness, and won't perform well. The solution to all of those issues is to construct a Data Warehouse based on Dimensional Modeling. I'll show you why normalized OLTP databases have problems supporting BI, and how Kimball method Data Warehouses don't.

## Title: How to decide if your database is a good candidate
 
**Abstract**:
We’ll be looking into the pros and cons of moving SQL Servers into a virtual server environment.  Specifically we’ll be looking into when it’s a good idea and when it’s probably not a good idea.  Like all problems in the database world there are no hard set answers as to if virtualization is a good idea, but there are some times when virtualizing a SQL Server is a good idea, and can save you some money.  There are some other times when you will be shooting yourself in the foot and shouldn’t.  We’ll be focusing on when how to make this decision, and how to gather the metrics that you need in order to come to this decision.

## Title: Dimension Processing with SSIS - Simple to Complex
 
**Abstract**:
The SCD Wizard included in Integration Services is easy to use, and has all the features you need for smaller, simple dimension processing. However, it is not the easiest component to adjust, and doesn't perform very well with larger dimensions. This session will cover three alternative techniques for processing changes to dimension tables within SSIS: "rolling your own SCD" with Lookups and Conditional Splits, using the T-SQL MERGE statement, and the Kimball Method SCD component. The strengths and weaknesses of each technique will be described and demonstrated.

## Title: Tuna Helper for DBAs and Developers
 
**Abstract**:
Many DBAs and developers are faced with tuning poorly performing SQL statements. There is no way to learn everything you need to know about SQL tuning in an hour, but you can learn a process to employ when badly written SQLs are ruining database performance. However, many tuning projects fail because the process being used is inefficient. This presentation will walk through a process I use with great success and it will include topics such as: SQL diagramming, wait type data, column selectivity, and others that will help you succeed on future tuning projects.

In this session, you will discover some of the common pitfalls that can cause T-SQL statements to run slow. A number of demos will be done to show how by making slight changes in your code will minimize the resources used to process your queries. From this session, you will be able to take home a list of T-SQL coding guidelines to help your code more efficient T-SQL statements.

## Title: SQL Server Service Broker in the Real World
 
**Abstract**:
Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and 2008 include a fantastic feature that few people understand or use.  That feature is the Microsoft SQL Server Service Broker.  The SQL Service Broker is one of the least used features within the database engine, and that lack of use is simply from last of knowledge about the feature.

In this session we’ll dig into how to configure the service broker for not only intra-database message queuing, but database to database queuing as well as server to server database queuing.  We will also dig into a real life scenario where the SQL Server Service Broker was used to do ETL from an OLTP database to an OLAP database in near real time for near real time reporting.

## Title: High Volume Real Time Contiguous ETL and Audit

High volume contiguous ETL is always problematic, and even more so when near-real-time is desired. This presentation goes through a solution collects and aggregates security audit data for nearly 400000 machines, a contiguous 24x7 stream of nearly 200 events per second, using a budget tight solution that involves SQL Express, Service Broker and Database Mirroring.
