## Title: The 4-hour DBA: Automate, Audit and Relax
 
**Abstract**:
Do you feel that you are overworked and always fighting fires and never can get ahead? In this session, I will help you identify what is important to your job and how to find the time to address those critical tasks.  I will share scripts to automate those tasks that are central to all DBAs and discuss how to establish a methodology to quickly automate daily database chores.  The flip side of automation is auditing.  Routine auditing your server is essential to avoid nasty surprises that can lead to a loss of control.  We will create an auditing system using features within SQL Server, including Policy Based Management and scripts that will provide you peace of mind to enjoy your work and maybe even life beyond the office.

## Title: The Periodic Table of Dynamic Management Objects
 
**Abstract**:
Taking the periodic table of elements into consideration I've created The Periodic Table of Dynamic Management Objects as a reference tool for these functions and views that have become so critical for today's SQL Server DBA to performance tune and gain metadata insights into their various SQL instances. In navigating the table we will examine key DMVs and DMFs of interest: requests, sessions, wait stats, indexes, system information will all be covered. We will also delve into how these DMOs - just like their elemental counterparts - can be combined to yeild interesting insights into your servers. We will also look at how things can go awry as well! Like mixing vinegar and baking soda, sometimes combining DMOs can cause a big mess too!

## Title: Table Vars and Temp Tables - What you NEED to Know
 
**Abstract**:
Almost every SQL Developer is familiar with Table Variables and Temporary Tables. While each of these objects represent temporary storage, there are also substantial differences between them. Understanding the differences between Table Variables and Temporary Tables, and the ramifications that those differences cause, is essential to being able to properly select the appropriate object for use in your development tasks. In this code filled session, we’ll discover the differences and similarities of Temporary Tables and Table Variables, dispel some widespread myths about each, and answer the most important questions of them all, "When do I use one or the other and what are the various impacts of doing so?"

## Title: Serene Velocity: Reporting Services and SSAS Data
 
**Abstract**:
SSRS 2008 R2 provides powerful capabilities to help us develop sophisticated reports from Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services. Unfortunately, many of these features, such as the server aggregation function, are commonly ignored by report developers. The result: redundant work in the reporting layer. In this session, BI Architect and MVP Bill Pearson exposes ways to optimize reporting from SSAS by writing MDX that leverages, rather than replicates, what the cube is designed to do best.

## Title: Automate Policy-Based Management using PowerShell
 
**Abstract**:
The Policy-Based Management feature in SQL Server 2008 provides a great way to ensure your systems are configured consistently and correctly, but it can be tedious to implement on each server in your environment.  PowerShell scripts allow you to automate the implementation of your policies so you can focus on more important problems.  This session will walk you through how PBM works, how to define your policies in PowerShell, and how to set up Agent jobs to evaluate those policies regularly to let you know when you need to take action.

## Title: Everything You Need to Know About SQL Azure 
 
**Abstract**:
Cloud computing is one of the hot topic issues of the day and Microsoft is pushing hard to show that they are in the game to win. As such, SQL Azure is your data storage in the cloud solution. However, the platform is much different from simply a SQL Server that sits in the cloud and needs to be approached in an intelligent manner.  In this fast paced session, we will be going well beyond the simple “hello world” scenario to show you how to leverage the cloud architecture for data storage as well as educate you in how the cloud works differently than your local database instance. This session is going to be an eye opener for sure and will have many of you dreaming of your data sitting in the cloud.

## Title: Beyond Plateaux: Optimize SSAS with Best Practices
 
**Abstract**:
Whether we inherit our Analysis Services environments from predecessors or create them - learning as we go - ourselves, we often conclude that performance (processing and / or querying) and functionality can be enhanced. In this session, Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson overviews ways to launch new capabilities, and to propel performance beyond its current plateau, using design best practices to better meet consumer performance and functional needs. This is the initial session of a set of detailed Best Practices presentations.

## Title: Writing faster queries
 
**Abstract**:
Poor database performance is the Achilles' heel of any system. Better and faster hardware can improve systems to a certain point. However, for truly great performing systems, there is no substitute for properly written queries and designed indexes. In this all-demo session we'll take a look at some common query performance killers, along with some no so obvious things that we can do to our queries to make them as fast as possible.

## Title: Understanding SSIS Performance
 
**Abstract**:
Many casual users of SSIS (including database professionals using the SSMS Import/Export Wizard) don't necessarily understand the inner workings of SSIS and what factors impact performance.  During this session, we'll look at different aspects of SSIS and discuss their impact on package performance.  We'll take a deep dive into the Data Flow component, looking at how SSIS manages data as it moves from sources, through transformations, and then to destinations.  Finally, we'll talk about several of the top performance killers casual SSIS users experience and discuss strategies for overcoming these common issues.

## Title: Master Data  Services in Denali 
 
**Abstract**:
Most DBAs at one time or another have been taught the importance of master data management(MDM), which is just comprised of a set of processes and tools in order to keep your non-transactional data in a consistent state. However, with today’s fast paced environment and tightening budgets most DBAs lack the resources to properly implement it. With the upcoming release of Denali, Microsoft has taken their second swipe at providing a tool known as Master Data Services(MDS) to aid the DBA in this endeavor. In this session, you will learn the basics of MDS in Denali  This session will definitely be an eye opener for some that ar

## Title: Add It Up: Analysis Services Aggregations
 
**Abstract**:
Are you looking to maximize the performance of your Analysis Services queries? This session explains what aggregations are and how they work. You’ll learn how to create aggregations, tune the aggregations based on actual usage, and design custom aggregations when necessary. You’ll discover the benefits and pitfalls of flexible aggregations, when to use rigid aggregations, and the meaning of lazy aggregation processing. You’ll dive into queries to see if aggregations are being used and learn when aggregations aren’t useful. If you thought aggregation design began and ended with the aggregation wizard, you owe it to yourself (and your cubes) to attend this session.

## Title: Monitoring Databases in a Virtual Environment
 
**Abstract**:
When moving databases to a virtual environment the performance metrics DBAs typically use to troubleshoot performance issues such as O/S metrics, storage configurations, CPU allocation and more become unreliable. DBAs no longer have a clear, reliable view of the factors impacting database performance. Understanding the difference between the physical and virtual server environment adds a new dimension to the DBA tasks. This presentation describes the changes that DBAs need to make in their performance and monitoring practices.

## Title: Let Service Broker Help You Scale Your Application
 
**Abstract**:
How your business applications interact with the corporate database directly can have a dramatic impact on how successful you are, and one of the biggest issues is performance with large databases.  By designing the application to use asynchronous messaging for non-critical updates you can focus performance concerns to where the timeliness is critical.  SQL Server Service Broker handles the asynchronous requests quickly and efficiently, and minimizes the conflicts with your critical updates.  This session will walk you through the steps to get Service Broker up and running and providing a consistent delivery of your business data.

## Title: Page Latches for Mere Mortals
 
**Abstract**:
Latching is a necessary function of the database engine. Although latching is a topic is normally presented only in expert-level sessions, a good grasp of the problems excessive latching exposes is important even for novice tuners. This session focuses on the PAGELATCH_* and PAGEIOLATCH_* wait types, explaining what is happening, why it is happening, and how to use the exposed information to tune queries and solve performance problems. If you've seen these wait types in Activity Monitor and wonder what they meant, then this session is for you!
