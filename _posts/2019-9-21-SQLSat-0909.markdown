## Title: Automate tests in your database with tSQLt
 
**Abstract**:
tSQLt is an easy-to-use database unit testing framework for Microsoft SQL Server. It is ideal for the database developer because tests are written in T-SQL.

This session explores how and why application unit testing is performed, and then focuses on unit testing database code with tSQLt.  We will learn how tests are structured, and how to set up realistic tests. We will talk about how much testing coverage is enough and when you can stop.

Even if you aren't able to fully implement Test Driven Development tomorrow, you'll walk away knowing how to future-protect that next tricky bit of logic with tests that will ensure your code produces desired results, not only the first time, but with all future modifications as well.

## Title: Data Modeling Trends for 2019 And Beyond1
 
**Abstract**:
It is so difficult to model data today. The number of products the average company uses to store data has exploded. The database vendors are competing and releasing features at an astounding rate. The cloud vendors have also accelerated the pace of change. In analytics, some people say there is no need for a star schema. In transactional systems, some people say that the EF Codd era is over and we can repeat data as often as we want. One blog writer says one thing, while another contradicts them.    These things are creating a confusing atmosphere for the data modeler.    

It is true that data modeling has changed, but there is no need to throw out great practices that have served us for years and can continue to do so. This session will cover what has changed for data modeling, why it changed, and how to take advantage of those changes. Combine new thinking with classic data architecture and you will create great analytic and transactional systems for your data.

## Title: CozyRoc: Dynamic Data Flows in SSIS Without Programming
 
**Abstract**:
This session is an introduction to the unique functionality offered by COZYROC to create integration packages that dynamically map columns at runtime. The standard SSIS Data Flow Task can only use static metadata which is defined when the package is initially designed. The mapping of columns is configured and remains unchanged until the package is re-opened and design changes are made, thus costing maintenance time and effort. Data Flow Task Plus extends the capabilities of the standard Microsoft Data Flow task in that it allows you to set up dynamic data flows, thus eliminating maintenance time and effort. Changes to tables and columns are automatically incorporated at run time without the need to change and redeploy the package. Columns and fields are mapped automatically at run time. Furthermore, the initial design time and effort may be greatly reduced when dealing with huge amounts of data in a large number of files and/or databases.

## Title: What just happened? Creating your own real-time dashboard with Grafana, Influx, and Telegraf
 
**Abstract**:
You wear many hats, know your KPI, fight those fires, and are used to -- but still scared of -- "hey, what just happened?"

As a DBA, you very likely have SQL Server well covered, but what about if/when you support Cassandra? Mongo? MySQL? What if you're DevOps and need something from ASP .Net? IIS? Nginx? 

In this interactive session, we'll go over show you how to locally install and configure InfluxDB to store your data, get Telegraf to pull, and with Grafana, create some quick dashboards.  Time permitting, we can set some thresholds, and send them to Slack. 

All of these tools are completely free, and if you don't have the right monitoring, or any, this is perfect for you.

## Title: One key to rule them all - how to effectively destroy data consistency, and ruin query performance
 
**Abstract**:
Every beginner knows that every table has an identity primary key, supported by a clustered index.
If I told you that these keys that you take for granted, are the primary factor that destroy your database's consistency, performance, scalability, and modularity, you'd probably think I'm crazy.
But what if I can prove it, scientifically, and beyond any reasonable doubt?
"It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know that just ain't so..."
Join me on this fascinating journey down the rabbit hole, where we will shed new light on some of the most fundamental aspects of database design. 
You will experience hands-on how you can drastically improve your database consistency, simplify your queries, improve performance by orders of magnitude, allow for unprecedented scalability, and modularity. Prepare for a paradigm shift. 
By the end of this session, you will chant with me:
"The key, the whole key, and nothing but the key, so help me Codd".

## Title: Reporting Services: A Smart Migration Strategy
 
**Abstract**:
With Power BI Report Server, you can host traditional paginated reports alongside Power BI analytical reports, KPIs, and mobile reports. 
This session will show how to use the data in the ReportServer database to determine a smart migration strategy for upgrading to a new SSRS or Power BI Report Server. Starting with the new features of Report Manager, Mobile Reports, KPIs, and the Mobile Report Publisher app. The session will then focus on how to utilize the report meta data in the ReportServer database, combined with the transaction log table, to show how to determine which reports, data sets, and data sources are being used and determine what objects to migrate. 

Learn how to use PowerShell to extract the reports and data sets from the database, instead of downloading them, to facilitate an easy migration to a new implementation. Also, discover a way of determining all TSQL used by the reports. This session is particularly useful for migrating from 2008, but applicable to any migra

## Title: Confidence – The Best Super-Power
 
**Abstract**:
Have you thought about wanting to do something and thought you may not be successful at it, so it then became too much work to try?  The American Pastor Robert Shuler famously asked a very powerful question: “What would you do if you knew you could not fail?”  Confidence allows us to dream big and gives us the fuel to escape from a world of apathy.  It gets us out of bed ready for action; ready to do something that will move us towards achieving whatever goal we set for ourselves.  Without the confidence to at least try, we are sure to fail.  If we try, but only half heartedly because we lack confidence, we will likely fail.  Confidence will improve your odds of success in any endeavor.  
Confidence is only 25% genetic.  Let’s improve the other 75%.

## Title: The SQL Career Roadmap for Women (and Men)
 
**Abstract**:
The ideal way to become a SQL Server professional is to get a degree, get a junior position, and then work your way up. But, the vast majority of data professionals don’t follow this path! Instead, most of us start out as “accidental DBAs” and fumble our way into a full time data career.
This is not ideal, and we could all use some help navigating through resumes, job hunting, interviews, and negotiating.
You’ll learn about all that in this session. We will also talk about how to get around a big obstacle for both women and men: how to get back to work after a long period of not working.
How can I get a database job with no experience? What’s the best way to learn the newest technology? What resources are out there? Bring your questions, and we’ll explore the answers.

## Title: Using Columnstore indexes in Azure DevOps Services. Lessons learned
 
**Abstract**:
The Analytics service in Azure DevOps Services provides all-over insights to your DevOps data: work item tracking, CI/CD pipelines, testing process etc. 
	 
Built on top of columnstore indexes, the Analytics service has to deal with 100s of millions records and daily growth in 10s of millions, only a few minutes delay from operation store, sub second query performance for in-product experiences as well as 3rd party extensions, Power BI integration and ad-hoc queries.
	 
Working on it, I've learned a lot of DOs and DON'Ts about columnstore indexes. Session covers how to:
* partition columnstore indexes in a multitenant environment
* maintain columnstore indexes in case of updates and/or purge to keep segment elimination possible
* evolve database schema without downtimes and maintenance windows
* design to benefit from predicate and aggregation pushdown
* deal with edge case like ad-hoc queries for raw data and paging
* choose between CCI and NCCI based on usage patterns

## Title: Assessing and Planning SQL Database Migrations to Azure
 
**Abstract**:
Today's enterprise is evolving at a rapid pace by taking advantage of what cloud services can offer.  By leveraging cloud's scalability, companies are re-architecting their data centers while doing cost optimization. 
In this presentation, we will do assess the on-premises environment and determining what workloads and databases are ready to make the move and what can you do to improve their Azure readiness while reducing downtime during the migration. 
Planning and assessment plays a critical role in moving to the cloud. We would see wide range of resources and tools to get assessment completed with ease while identifying workload dependencies with practical tips and tricks focusing on sizing and costs. And finally, we'll assess the SQL instances and identify their readiness for Azure as well. 
By the end of this presentation , you'll be able to confidently identify your on-premises workloads and databases that are Azure-ready, or almost ready.

## Title: From the Trenches - Case Study of a Data Warehouse Migration  Upgrade
 
**Abstract**:
There's an old adage about rebuilding the airplane while you're flying it.  That sounds a bit like our recent project - planning  executing a hardware migration, and SQL/OS upgrade, of a complex Data Warehouse environment.  The components include:  multi-TB DBs, SSIS (mix of SSISDB Catalog  old-school Pkg Store), SSRS (via SharePoint integration), SSIS, SSAS (mix of MDX  Tabular), WhereScape, DNS Aliases, multiple job schedulers, various drivers/scripts/apps, and implementation of an AlwaysOn AG.    

We'll outline pitfalls to avoid, and walk you through hard-won lessons and strategies for success.  We'll discuss our automated process for continuous deployment, which greatly reduced downtime and risk.  Of course, we'll share relevant technical tips  tricks.  Possible guest-starring appearances from Chris and Dan, who were key players in the success of this project.

## Title: Big Data, Big Dupe: A little session about a big bunch of nonsense.
 
**Abstract**:
If data is the new oil, then Big Data is the new snake oil. 
For over a decade, Big Data has managed to delude far too many smart, honest, hard-working data practitioners, with nothing but the best intentions.
This session is a plea for your common sense and decency. 
Together, we will use history, facts, authority, and logic to expose it for what it really is. 
Layer by layer, we will peel off the Confusion, Illusion, Deception, Distraction and the Regression that is "Big Data".
You will realize just how much progress and value Big Data has bestowed on us over the past decade.
But more importantly, we will see what we can and must do to make data practice, and consequently the world, a better place. 
Brace yourself for a thought-provoking session, filled with "Aha" moments. 
I promise that after this session, you will never look at big data the same way as you did before you stepped into the room.

## Title: Dive into the Query Optimizer - Undocumented Insight
 
**Abstract**:
This 500 level session will focus on using undocumented statements and trace flags to get insight into how the query optimizer works and show you which operations it performs during query optimization. I will use these undocumented features to explain what the query optimizer does from the moment a query is submitted to SQL Server until an execution plan is generated including operations like parsing, binding, simplification, trivial plan, and full optimization. Concepts like transformation rules, the memo structure, how the query optimizer generates possible alternative execution plans, and how the best alternative is chosen based on those costs will be explained as well.

**Abstract**:
What is a T-SQL framework and how will it help you as a developer.

In this session we will create a framework that we can leverage through a template that will take care of the tedious tasks that come with development.  These tasks or features include audit logging, designing a dynamic data driven error handling process, and control level batching in order to document, troubleshoot, and base line your code base.  Once these features are developed you can spend more time in doing what really needs to happen like developing logic to perform processes while allowing the framework to control the necessary error handling tasks for you so you can continue to produce rapid development code.

## Title: Know What Your Code is Doing to SQL Server!
 
**Abstract**:
ORMs - oh how I LOVE them! As a consultant, when I see them in play at a client I go KACHIIINNNNGGGG!! :-D Seriously though, they can provide some substantial benefits for coding throughput. But if you don't Read The Fine Manual and do some things right and avoid some major gotchas, you will fall prey to one of my favorite Guruisms: "Anything that allows developers to slap code together more quickly is inversely proportional to the performance, concurrency and scalability you will get from that code"! Although this talk is based on Entity Framework, all ORMs suffer from the same flaws.

## Title: Basic Windowing Functions
 
**Abstract**:
Windowing functions are when you add a "window" to which rows a function will look at using the OVER clause. We'll start by learning how to add the OVER clause to the commonplace COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX aggregate functions, since the OVER clause is optional. From there, we'll learn some ranking functions, which do require the OVER clause. You'll see examples that use the ROW_NUMBER function to identify and delete duplicate rows. Finally, we'll close with the RANK and DENSE_RANK functions that help you report on the grouping of your data.

## Title: Tune Like a Guru - The Big Three!
 
**Abstract**:
EVERY client I engage with is taught to RUN 3 SCRIPTS IMMEDIATELY, WITHOUT THOUGHT AND WITHOUT DELAY as soon as a performance problem is noted. I am exceptionally good at performance tuning and forensics, but I (nor anyone else out there) cannot get at the root cause of a problem without information about the occurrence. These scripts will give you said information, which is very often transient in nature! I could be putting myself out of work teaching stuff like this! :-D

**Jared Kirkpatrick**
 
My life in the tech world started at Dell a little before the Windows 95 release. I started my MCSE there and took the Database track toward a MCDBA and never looked back. I’ve been head down in data ever since. My first exposure to SQL Server was with SQL 6.5. In addition to schooling at Wentworth Military Academy and two years at Southwestern University in San Marcos, Texas, my certifications are MCP, MCP+I, MCSE (NT 4.0), and MCDBA (2000). During my SQL journey, I have been a Supporting Author of SQL Server 2000 Blackbook, presenter at several PASS Chapters and at SQLSaturday, when it was still in the single digits! I was the IBM Principal Consultant for Honeywell and HR Logic, and Senior Developer for Match.com.

I started as a night shift computer operator out of high school. I moved to applications development after graduation from SAC. After a few years with the State as an applications developer, the manager of Systems Programming decided it would be better to have me on the inside looking out rather than on the outside trying to get in. I spent the next 14 years as a mainframe system programmer for two state agencies. In 1996 I moved to Healthcare IT and have been that ever since. I’ve spent most of the past 14 years doing ETL, performance and HIPAA security. In these various jobs, I’ve used all manner of databases including InfoTec IMP, IBM VSAM and DB2, Interbase, Informix, Universe, Oracle 9i and SQL Server from 6.0 to 2008 R2.
