## Title: XML Without Xanax: How to Handle XML in SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Do you cringe whenever you have to look at an XML document? Does the very thought of XML data living in your database make you scream? Do you have a panic attack any time you have to parse XML? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then this session is for you!

We'll start with reasons why having XML in SQL Server might be a good thing, then we'll face our fears and turn tabular data into XML, and finally we'll confront the true source of our anxiety by parsing XML back into tabular data using xQuery.

If you survive this session, you'll have faced your fears about XML in SQL Server, you'll have a solid understanding of creating XML from tabular data, and you'll know how to use xQuery to parse XML.

## Title: Geekin’ Out on Extended Events -Deconstructing the system_health session to solve performance issues
 
**Abstract**:
Extended Events are used to gather a wide range of performance information to help troubleshoot performance problems in SQL Server. The system_health session is an Extended Events session that is included by default with SQL Server. This session starts automatically when the SQL Server database engine starts, and runs without any noticeable performance effects. This presentations will take you on an in-depth tour of the data provided in the system_health event session and how to use it to troubleshoot performance issues. Cases studies from real-life examples will be used to demonstrate tips and tricks.

## Title: Partitioning System for "WORM" Tables - Part 2 - Deep Dive on the Code
 
**Abstract**:
This isn't your typical talk on "partitioning".  This is a deep dive on the code for the problems and desired results for partitioning things like the "Audit" Table covered in Part 1.  It's strongly recommended that you attend Part 1 where the groundwork for this session has been laid out.  In this session, we'll build a 4 million-row test table and do the initial partitioning.  We'll follow that up with the monthly process to re-index and compress the latest full partition automatically every month and do a deep dive on a view that makes monitoring partitions easy.  This code helped me reduce backups to 1/60th the amount of time that they used to take.  There's a ton of ancillary learning in the code, as well.  Don't let the "advanced" rating of this session scare you away because it's written for all levels to understand.

## Title: Who Moved My Tuple--Columnstore Indexes in SQL Server 2014.
 
**Abstract**:

Data Warehouse workloads can be very large and taxing on your database server. With the modern demands of real-time analytics against growing volumes of data this challenge continues. When columnstore indexes and batch mode query processing were introduced in SQL Server 2012 were a performance game changer. In the 2012 implementation of columnstore, direct updating and inserting of data was not supported and other restrictions, such as data types limited the use of the feature. SQL 2014 removes those limitations—you can use a columnstore index as a clustered index, and more importantly directly perform DML against the index. Also, more query operators support batch mode, which means more of your queries can see performance benefits. You will understand the changes for 2014—and how having updateable columnstore indexes may cause changes to your process design. You will see the power of columnstore indexes in analytics, their limits, and how to include them into your system design.

## Title: Partitioning System for "WORM" Tables - Part 1 - The Theory and the Problems
 
**Abstract**:
This isn't your typical talk on "partitioning".  This is a deep dive into all the problems that you'll run into when partitioning new or existing "Write Once, Read Many" tables, such as large Audit Tables, and how to code around them.  You'll also learn the methods to support three of the best reasons for partitioning such monster tables... MUCH shorter nightly index maintenance, MUCH shorter and smaller backups, and MUCH shorter "Get back in business" piecemeal restores.  We'll also learn how to do the "impossible"... compact a File Group (one per partition) so that there's virtually no unused space in the underlying file.  After all, we don't want to set any "free" disk-space to "Read Only".  Don't let the "Advanced" rating of this session scare you away.  Anyone with a decent handle on T-SQL (or wants one) will be able to understand this session because "all will be explained" and there will be oodles of well-documented code to back up the explanations.

## Title: What Every DBA Needs To Know About Storage For SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Do you have issues communicating your needs to your Storage/SAN Administrator? Do they seem to speak a different language when it comes to determining and providing your SQL Server storage needs?  In this session we'll review storage technologies so that you can communicate effectively with your Storage/SAN Administrator as well as methods of monitoring your storage to ensure that your needs are met.
In this session we will discuss RAID types, Local/Direct Attached Storage vs SAN Storage, and Flash Storage (including how it fits into multiple storage models).  We'll also review methods for monitoring and testing your storage performance.  With the information gathered in this session, you'll be able to have thorough, informed discussions with your Storage Administrator as well as being able to provide solid metrics to confirm storage performance.

## Title: Table Vars  Temp Tables - What you NEED to Know!
 
**Abstract**:
Almost every SQL Developer is familiar with Table Variables and Temporary Tables. While each of these objects represent temporary storage, there are also substantial differences between them. Understanding the differences between Table Variables and Temporary Tables, and the ramifications that those differences cause, is essential to being able to properly select the appropriate object for use in your development tasks. In this code filled session, we’ll discover the differences and similarities of Temporary Tables and Table Variables, dispel some widespread myths about each, and answer the most important questions of them all, "When do I use one or the other and what are the various impacts of doing so?"

## Title: SSAS, MD.: Tuning your cubes for fast processing and faster queries
 
**Abstract**:
Do you have an Analysis Services Multidimensional cube that isn't working right? Is it slow and non-performing? Does it take a REALLY long time to process? In this session, we'll review some of the best practices that you can put against your SSAS cube to get it running at peak efficiency. We'll discuss how to optimize dimension processing and why attribute relationships are so important, and what makes distinct count measure groups special. We'll also discuss why SSAS has 2 engines under the covers, and how you can use this knowledge to performance tune your cube to address the right bottleneck.

## Title: Turbo Boost Performance: In Memory Tables index optimizations
 
**Abstract**:
With the introduction of in-memory based tables in SQL Server 2014, it’s natural to expect  significant increases in query performance. But what do we do when queries which utilize in-memory tables actually start to perform same or, in some cases, even worse than their equivalent disk based table predecessors?  In this session, we are going to take a look at the changes to the indexing design for in-memory based objects and how it differs from existing disk based table indexing. Also, we are going to cover how to choose the appropriate indexes for your in-memory object to give you the performance boost that you have been expecting.

## Title: Spatial Data - Looking Outside the Map
 
**Abstract**:
I've said it before and I'll say it again, spatial data doesn't get much love in SQL Server.  It is a feature worthy of much appreciation and will become more vital as more location data is collected.  In this session we will explore spatial data and discover many ways it can be used for incredible analytics.  You will learn some new ways to visualize your data outside of the typical plots on a Bing map layer.  Come and learn how powerful spatial data can be even though it lacks a snazzy "power" title.

## Title: Building dynamic SSIS packages for more flexibility
 
**Abstract**:
After building a handful of SSIS packages, you probably want to have more flexibility to make the package execution more dynamic.  In this session, we will learn how to use  variables, expressions, and loops to do things like: extract data to a file with *today's* date in the file name, load all files in a directory at the same time, and loop through a set of servers to gather data.  For this session, you should already be familiar with how to create SSIS packages to load data from flat files and extract data to flat files.

## Title: The Data Warehouse is Dead! Long Live the Data Warehouse! 
 
**Abstract**:
Okay, the Data Warehouse isn't really dead. But, it's time to think past your favorite textbook and begin looking at practical solutions that fit the schedule, budget, and team you're working with. In this session, we'll discuss design options, implementation considerations, and lessons gained from the many mistakes the presenter has made over the years. This is a highly interactive session, so bring your ideas, opinions, and experiences.

## Title: Fixing Page Life Expectancy
 
**Abstract**:
Starting with what Page Life Expectancy really means to query, server, and disk performance, we’ll get a firm understanding of what this counter means to you. After that we can start talking about if and how you want to raise it. It’s important to know that this is just a counter and there are situations where you don’t care about it nearly as much as you’d expect. It’s also important to know what effect a drop in PLE mid-day really means beyond query performance, including a possible impact on other, unrelated servers.

## Title: Before You Optimize: Understanding Execution Plans
 
**Abstract**:
You know what your query does, but do you know how it does it?  Do you know what type of resources your query uses?  Come to this session to find the answers to these questions and more as we walk through reading execution plans.  We will see how SQL breaks down the execution of your query and what each step tells us about the overall query.  If you are newer to Microsoft SQL or you just don’t feel totally comfortable with reading execution plans, this session is for you.

## Title: Troubleshooting SQL Server Performance Using Wait Stats
 
**Abstract**:
Sometimes the hardest part of diagnosing performance issues is determining where to start. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could just ask SQL Server what’s slowing it down? Good news: you can! Every single time SQL Server has to wait on a resource it keeps track of it in its Wait Stats. That valuable data can be used to narrow down your troubleshooting efforts and help you get to the root cause quicker. This session will provide an introduction to Wait Stats and explain how they can be leveraged to improve your performance tuning skills.

## Title: Top 5 Ways to Improve Your triggers
 
**Abstract**:
You've got a piece of code that you want to implement as a trigger, but you've read that triggers can grind your performance to a halt. Developers everywhere write triggers to implement business logic, to enforce certain types of constraints, or to avoid changing database schema or external code. Many triggers are inefficient and violate best practices -- but it doesn't have to be this way. Come learn how to improve your triggers and keep them off the list of potential scapegoats for your SQL Server performance woes.
