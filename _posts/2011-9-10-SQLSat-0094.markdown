## Title: Visual Report Design: Bringing Sexy Back
 
**Abstract**:
Do your users have the same old, mundane table reports they’ve been using for decades? Stop living in the past and make your reports pop. Learn to use design patterns, best practices and visuals that pack more usable information into fewer, more usable reports. Use Reporting Services and other Microsoft BI tools to create dynamic, browse-able reports that answer important business questions at a glance and then let them explore the details to gain business insight and take action.

Sure, Business Intelligence is all the rage but you don’t have to invest in an entire BI platform to have fresh, usable reports. These design techniques apply to enterprise analytic solutions and smaller-scale operational reporting.

## Title: Devs are from Mars, Report Servers are from Venus
 
**Abstract**:
Do you remember what it was like to fall in love? Wasn't it wonderful? Lately it just hasn't been the same. You've been stuck in the same old routine, doing the same old charts and tables. Maybe Reporting Services doesn’t tell you what’s wrong. Maybe you're even thinking about seeing other reporting products (!) In this session made for report developers, Doug will re-ignite your passion for RS by showing you how to design for better performance, explaining what RS has been trying to tell you through logs (but you haven't been listening), and demonstrating some new -- and easy -- tricks you may not have known RS can do. After this session, you'll want to spend some time alone with your new old flame.

## Title: Parallel Processing Database Architecture
 
**Abstract**:
If you want to architect a parallel processing system, Data Vault should be your preferred architecture.  In this session I will introduce you to the Data Vault design pattern and demonstrate the major performance advantages of this architecture.  Data Vault hub, link and satellite tables allow for vertical and horizontal partitioning of data.  When properly implemented, your database tables will provide the most index coverage of any indexing system and provide the fastest possible disk scan access.  I will provide a real world example of a parallel manufacturing execution system that we developed at Abound Solar which implements the Data Vault architecture.

## Title: Utility Database
 
**Abstract**:
If you were asked what average runtime was of your slowest stored procedure, could you provide the answer? What if you needed to provide that information for last month? Do you review your error logs each day? Do you know the growth percentages of your databases for the past year or even the past month? If your database has an unusual growth event will you know about it? 

In the utility database that we create during this session we will track stored procedure information along with information about the hard drives such as free space. We will look at how you can have the errors in your error logs emailed to you each day. The goal of this session is to help you automate and centralize as many of your day-to-day tasks as you can.

**Abstract**:
Is your data secured? Are you a victim of SQL Injection? You'll discover some commonly overlooked practices in securing your SQL Server databases. Learn about physical security, passwords, privileges and roles, and preventative best practices. I'll demonstrate auditing and we will take a quick look at some .Net code samples to use on your applications. Get up to speed on the new security features in "Denali", the next version of SQL Server. Takeaway the 20/20 vision to identify SQL Injection and other database vulnerabilities and how to prevent them.

## Title: Attribute Discretization in Analysis Services (BI)
 
**Abstract**:
Attribute discretization is an oft-overlooked feature in Analysis Services that allows us to automatically create a manageable number of groups of attribute values that are clearly separated by boundaries. Discretization can help us to make it easier for information consumers to work with large numbers of possible attribute member values. In this session, Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson discusses the varied options, the design (and other) considerations involved, and best practices surrounding the use of this capability.

## Title: Documentation – you know you love it
 
**Abstract**:
We will discuss some of the most important things that you as a Data Professional can document to make your job much easier, ensure information consistency between groups, and better prepare your organizations for raising the bar on your day to day business.  Think of this as a sort of Database Library that allows you to finally detail the processes you follow currently to perform repetitive tasks.  This Library will also allow you to simply document your systems for your and others knowledge.  Some of the documents and processes we will review are:

## Title: Data File Sizes – How much is enough, if you don’t
 
**Abstract**:
We often run a fine line between how much space we need, and how much space we have for our databases.  Having too much drive space can be a waste of resources; however, running out of space is an obvious issue.  Let’s find a way to straddle the line and determine just how much space we really need, give ourselves a bit more than that, and make it a regular process to baseline, then continue to monitor, make adjustments along the way if needed, and ultimately plan for just enough space to get us through the year on budget.  
We’ll talk about a stand-alone tool that I used to determine space use for baseline, continued monitoring of the space used, and ensuring we have enough but not too much space.

## Title: Managing and Auditing SQL Server Permissions
 
**Abstract**:
When your boss asks you who has access to your databases, do you break out into a cold sweat? Or, instead, are you worried about those other people who might have 'sa' access to your server and might be causing trouble on your server? Either way, as DBAs we need to be able to audit our SQL Server security. This presentation will give you a general overview of the different types of roles that you can use to manage access, what they mean, and how we look at the security gremlins hiding under the covers of our databases.

## Title: But it worked great in Dev!  Performance for Devs
 
**Abstract**:

If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.

## Title: Understanding SQL Server XML Features 
 
**Abstract**:

The XML Functionality embedded into SQL Server 2005 and 2008 is one of its most powerful yet least understood features.  This seems to be primarily because DBA's shy away from it and developers prefer to work with XML in their code.  In this session we will explore the XML features of SQL Server and how we can bridge these two worlds. Topics covered will include retrieving relational data as XML, storing XML in the database using the XML Datatype, XML indexes, and the XQuery functions included in SQL Server.  We will also look at using XML as stored procedure parameters as a way to pass large amounts of complex data between client and server.

## Title: Table Fission - An Introduction to Partition|ing
 
**Abstract**:
Partitioning technology distributes data in a single table among several individual filegroups.  When implemented carefully, this allows DBAs to instantaneously move large amounts of data from one table to another.  After this session, attendees will understand how partitioning works, when it is beneficial, and how to implement a basic setup.  We will also illustrate partitioning in a practical "sliding window" demonstration.  This will be a broad, high-level introduction to the technology.
