## Title: Self-Service ETL with Power Query
 
**Abstract**:
Before any significant data analysis can take place the data often needs to be transformed, aggregated, and combined. This is often referred to as the ETL (Extraction, Transfer, and Load) process. Power Query is an excellent tool in the Microsoft self-service BI stack that allows business users to discover, combine, and refine data before loading it into a Power Pivot model for further analysis. In addition Microsoft has made connecting to a wide variety of sources including relational, structured, and semi structured data a consistent intuitive experience. This session guides you through using Power Query to extract, transform, and load data from various sources into a Power Pivot model. In addition we will look at the M language created by the tool and look at some advanced queries you can create using M.

## Title: What Every DBA Needs To Know About Storage For SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Do you have issues communicating your needs to your Storage/SAN Administrator? Do they seem to speak a different language when it comes to determining and providing your SQL Server storage needs?  In this session we'll review storage technologies so that you can communicate effectively with your Storage/SAN Administrator as well as methods of monitoring your storage to ensure that your needs are met.
In this session we will discuss RAID types, Local/Direct Attached Storage vs SAN Storage, and Flash Storage (including how it fits into multiple storage models).  We'll also review methods for monitoring and testing your storage performance.  With the information gathered in this session, you'll be able to have thorough, informed discussions with your Storage Administrator as well as being able to provide solid metrics to confirm storage performance.

## Title: Do More With Less: Inside SQL Agent Multi-Server Administration
 
**Abstract**:
One of the of the most under-utilized management features of SQL Server is SQL Agent Multi-Server Administration, which allows you to create a SQL Agent job on one server and then deploy it to multiple servers instantly. This allows you to have consistency with your SQL Agent jobs by managing them in a single location. You’ll learn about the benefits, drawbacks, workarounds, and underlying objects behind this technology. You’ll discover how to monitor job execution status and handle the security implications of the master-target relationship. Native Yinzer and SQL Server MVP Mike Hillwig will show you how to to deploy this simple, yet powerful feature right out of the box without writing a single line of additional code.

## Title: Disabling xp_CmdShell…Is it Really a “Best Practice”?
 
**Abstract**:
XP_CmdShell is a powerful tool that can greatly simplify the life of DBAs.
You can quickly and easily write full ETL systems, up/down-load FTP files, call PowerShell scripts to interrogate the status of hard-disks across the enterprise with nary a 3rd party tool in sight, and much more. 
And it’s all done under the control a scheduled job system that you already know and that keeps its own logs.
Yet, you'll find millions of people that agree that disabling xp_CmdShell is a "best practice". Some even say that it should never be used. Why? Disabling it supposedly decreases the system "surface area" of possible attack and never using it supposedly solves the problem of someone elevating their privileges with it.
Well, surprise! Disabling xp_CmdShell doesn't actually solve any of those problems.  In fact, disabling it may actually hurt security.
Come to this session to find out why turning off xp_CmdShell may be a "worst practice" and how to allow individuals/applications to run it safely.

## Title: Automating "Excel Hell" with T-SQL
 
**Abstract**:
Truly automate complex monthly spreadsheet imports without monthly code changes!

Right or wrong, spreadsheets still constitute a source of data that many of us have to import every week or month. The trouble is that most spreadsheets aren’t setup to look like an SQL table. Rather, they are setup as multiple dimensions to aid in user readability and that makes column mapping and importing seriously automation resistant.

This “Black Arts” session provides an introduction to a relatively simple method to quickly, easily, and automatically import such spreadsheets and the code to do so frequently requires no changes to be used across multiple disparate spreadsheets. Creation of the necessary staging table and the related mapping is all done automatically and the monthly addition of columns is automatically handled, as well. Some of the pitfalls of more traditional import methods will also be examined.

Don’t let the “Advanced” rating of this session scare you away. It's simple!

## Title: "Can I Get A Report of This?":  Introduction to SSRS
 
**Abstract**:
In the day-to-day operations of business, how often have we heard or even asked someone the question ourselves, “Can I get a report of this?”  Regardless of your area of expertise, reporting has become a necessity and requirement among businesses and is impacting our roles as IT professionals.  With the huge wave of trendy reporting tools and software surrounding the BI industry, many people are unaware or often overlook SSRS as a reporting solution.  In this session, we will look at the features and capabilities of SSRS, as well as supply you with the tools to begin fulfilling basic report requests.   At the conclusion of this session, you will know the difference between Report Builder and SQL Server Data Tools to determine which one is suitable for your needs.  You will also be able to create and deploy a basic report consisting of a data source, data set, a parameter and a row group.

## Title: Hacking Expos#233; - Using SSL to Secure SQL Server Connections
 
**Abstract**:
You know all the ways to protect your database when it is at rest, but what about when someone connects and starts running some queries? What if they connect and don't do anything? Just how exposed is that data? 
We will assume the role of a hacker and, by using a simple technique, we will sniff packets on a network to reveal what data is being sent. You may be shocked! 
We will then secure our database connections with a simple self-signed SSL certificate. 
Once secured, we will resume the role of the hacker and look inside the packets to see what has changed. 
*Warning - Do not try these demos at work without proper permissions as actual hacking techniques are used. 

PreReqs: This session only requires you to have a basic knowledge of SQL Server configuration and an interest in protecting the data in your database.

Goal 1: Learn what is exposed when using the default, unprotected connections to SQL Server
Goal 2: Learn how to configure SQL Serve to use an SSL certificate t

## Title: Dynamic SQL: Build Fast, Flexible Queries
 
**Abstract**:
Dynamic SQL is a misunderstood and much maligned part of a DBA’s tool kit – it can be used to solve difficult business problems, respond to diverse data needs, and alleviate performance problems. Many DBAs reject dynamic SQL outright as a potential source of SQL injections, being poorly performing, or just for being a hacky solution in general. Not so! 

Jeremiah Peschka has been making extensive use of dynamic SQL throughout his career to solve a variety of problems. In this session, we’ll be dispelling these misconceptions and demonstrating how dynamic SQL can become a part of every DBA’s tool kit.

## Title: Fixing Page Life Expectancy
 
**Abstract**:
Starting with what Page Life Expectancy really means to query, server, and disk performance, we’ll get a firm understanding of what this counter means to you. After that we can start talking about if and how you want to raise it. It’s important to know that this is just a counter and there are situations where you don’t care about it nearly as much as you’d expect. It’s also important to know what effect a drop in PLE mid-day really means beyond query performance, including a possible impact on other, unrelated servers.
