## Title: Relational Design Critique
 
**Abstract**:
The process of designing a relational database is not overly complex, and may be done by almost anyone on the development team. The process requires one to take the time to understand the requirements, when they exist, and apply a straightforward set of transforms to produce table structures that meets the needs. The tough part is that the process requires time and experience, neither of which anyone has enough of. In this session, to help the attendee differentiate right-enough designs from overly simple or overly complex designs, we will look at a variety of database snippets, each inspired from a real life design. We will discuss the pros and cons of the approach taken, and consider possible remediations to learn from a failure that was made by someone else.

## Title: Advanced T-SQL Development with latest features.
 
**Abstract**:
In the last releases,  SQL Server development was enriched with new T-SQL features, such as CTE (common table extension), array of Ranking and Windowing functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, TILE), MERGE statement, OUTPUT clause, EXCEPT and INTERSECT just to name a few. For various reasons some DBA/Developers do not utilize these new features. In this session, the audience will see demonstrations of the different practical use cases where these features can make T-SQL coding more efficient. This 100% code-based demo session highlights efficiency to utilize the latest T-SQL functions over conventional methods with the same functionality. The session will cover in depth live scenarios where these features have proven performance efficiency, code re

## Title: Disaster Documents: The role of documentation in disaster recovery
 
**Abstract**:
I was an employee of a company that had an office in the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001.  Prior to that infamous date, I had written several departmental documents that ended up being critical to our recovery.  In this presentation, I provide a narrative of what happened in the weeks following 9/11, and how documentation played a role in getting the organization back on its feet.

While other disaster recovery presentations talk about strategies, plans, and techniques, this presentation focuses on the documentation itself.  We will discuss the documents we had and how they were used in our recovery.  We will also discuss what documents we didn't have, and how they could have made the process better.

## Title: Using Modular Scripts to Perform SQL Compliance Audits in Seconds
 
**Abstract**:
Security audits such as PCI, STIG, or HIPAA, are important and can be complicated. Depending on the requirements it can take considerable time to gather the information needed.
In this session, we will go over some scripts that are used for compliance audits that make it easy to collect the information required. Even when there are multiple SQL Servers, these scripts and processes can quickly and easily identify where to focus efforts to ensure compliance. Through heavy demonstration and discussion, you will leave with a better equipped to understand and obtain compliance within your SQL Server environment.

## Title: Staging data for Azure SQL services
 
**Abstract**:
Most companies are faced with the ever-growing big data problem.  There have been two schools of thought on how to solve this problem.

Schema on write is represented by the traditional relational database table. Only a small portion of the total data owned by the company resides in the database.

Schema on read is represented by technologies such as Hadoop or PolyBase. All data owned by the company can reside in simple storage.

Today, we will learn how to stage data using Azure blob storage which can be ingested by both techniques.

1 – Grab some big data.
2 – Create blob storage account.
3 – Copy data to container.
4 – Azure SQL database plumbing.
5 – Loading data with BULK INSERT.
6 – Azure SQL data warehouse plumbing.
7 – Loading data with POLYBASE.
8 – Azure automation with RUNBOOKS.

## Title: I/O Tuning 101
 
**Abstract**:
One of the most common problems I have encountered as a DBA is the complaints from users that a particular query is slow, just one query.  Many times one that used to run in acceptable time, but that over time has slowed down substantially.

In this session we will show some of the causes for this, with emphasis on I/O requests being too high for the query.  

First part of the session will explain how to find these numbers, looking at a few queries with some major performance issues, including explaining why they have a problem.

The second part will focus on how to reduce I/O requests.

All of this can be done without the need for any 3rd party tools, all within the scope of what is available to SQL Server, all versions, all editions, including Azure.

## Title: Do Your Data Visualizations Need A Makeover?
 
**Abstract**:
Do you ever look at your data visualizations and feel that they are lackluster? Have you made a report using the latest chart types, but you still can’t gain adoption from your target audience? Lots of people feel this way, but they can’t quite identify what should be changed or how to change it. This session will help you identify signs that it’s time to give your data visualizations a makeover and provide practical tips for improving your reports and dashboards. We’ll discuss how simple changes in design choices related to color, chart types, chart formatting, and report layout can make a big difference in creating clear and engaging visualizations with common analysis tools like Power BI and Excel.

## Title: Whoa! Backup, what happened? The Basics of Backups
 
**Abstract**:
This session will start with performing a basic backup and restore of a database and then discuss the difference between FULL, Differential and Transaction backups. From there I will discuss many of the available options for backups, including backups of specific database files, to multiple files and different restore options.

Many DBAs still setup their backups via a GUI and “fire and forget” and don’t think about backups and restores until too late. This session will show you while that works in many cases, for larger or more complex databases, or databases with specialized HA requirements, the out of the box solution may be far from optimal.

## Title: Disaster Recovery - Done Dirt Cheap
 
**Abstract**:
Operating on a budget can result in some creative solutions. Recently I've come up with a creative solution for traditional on-premise client-server solutions that allows for full redundancy in the cloud, but at a budget price. This is accomplished through VMs, copying of logs to Blob Storage, automation of hydration, updates  de-allocation.  It may be a bit of a Rube Goldberg machine, but it works! The result is an extremely pro-rated and affordable DR solution that is restorable to within 1 hour or less of production. Come to this session to learn more about the hurdles faced when putting this solution together and to brainstorm together how it can even be improved.

## Title: Getting your Database off to a Right Start
 
**Abstract**:
When you create a new database do you ensure you have done everything you can to give it the chance to shine when things get tough? How many times have you seen a database created with all the defaults and down the road it becomes out of control due to the size, amount of data or even activity? If you really want to ensure your database can scale and perform well at all times you need to do the proper homework before you create the database. We will walk thru the various factors that affect performance and scalability under real life conditions and help you understand how to properly configure them up front to avoid issues down the road. Scalability is all about having a proper foundation to build on.

## Title: Database Project Makes Deployment Consistent
 
**Abstract**:
The deployment process is frustrating; an object is missing, an object is deployed in the wrong order or an incorrect version. Deploying to multiple environments like Dev, QA, UAT, and Prod is a challenge whether on-premise or in the cloud. Source controlling database objects is paramount. Team development is required. Database code will only be deployed when changed. Proper security deployment will be repeatable per environment. Together, let us discover how using Database Project will help us with consistent releases. Deployments can cause you trouble but we will share a reliable deployment and version control process. Let’s see how Database Project can help us accomplish this goal.

## Title: Parameters in SQL Server - Query Performance Makers or Breakers
 
**Abstract**:
T-SQL programming makes wide use of parameterization in stored procedures, dynamic statements and ad-hoc queries. Many developers aren’t aware of the significant influence they have on query performance. Incorrect use or lack of parameters is a common reason for query performance issues.
Have you experienced a query that always ran fast, suddenly (and for "no reason") become slow? And with nothing changing? Yep!
* In this session we will learn about how the plan cache deals with queries that are (and are not) parameterized. 
* You'll learn about parameter sniffing, what it is, and how it's handled in the older and newest versions of SQL. 
* We will explore the problem of mismatched data types and implicit conversions - and how that ties in with ORM generated code. 
* Lastly, we'll take a peek at value list handling from applications, and how using a table valued parameter as an input instead.
If this is a new topic to you, you'll leave this session with takeaways galore.

## Title: Effective Data Warehouse Storage Patterns
 
**Abstract**:
Many companies start off with a simple data mart for reporting. As the company grows, users become dependent on the data mart for monitoring and making decisions on Key Performance Indicators (KPI).

Unexpected information growth in your data mart may lead to a performance impacted reporting system. In short, your users will be lining up at your cube for their daily reports.

How do you reduce the size of your data mart and speed up data retrieval?  This presentation will review the following techniques to fix your woes.

Techniques:
1 – What is horizontal partitioning?
2 – Database sharding for daily information.
3 – Working with files and file groups.
3 – Partitioned views for performance.
4 – Table and Index partitions.
5 – Row Data Compression.
6 – Page Data Compression.
7 – Programming a sliding window.
8 – What is different in Azure SQL database?

## Title: Faster SSIS
 
**Abstract**:
Ever wonder why SSIS runs so slowly? Watch SSIS author Andy Leonard as he runs test loads using sample and real-world data, and shows you how to tune SQL Server 2016 Integration Services (SSIS 2016) packages.

We'll start by experimenting with SSIS design patterns to improve performance loading AdventureWorks data. We will implement different change detection patterns and compare execution performance for each. Then, we'll explain a Data Flow Task's bottleneck when loading binary large objects - or Blobs. 

Finally, we'll demonstrate a design pattern that uses a Script Component in a Data Flow to boost load performance to MySql, whether on-premises or in the cloud.

## Title: Managing and Architecting Azure Data Platform
 
**Abstract**:
In this daylong session, we’ll review all the various infrastructure components that make up the Microsoft Azure platform. When it comes to moving SQL Server systems into the Azure platform having a solid understanding of the Azure infrastructure will make migrations successful and making support solutions much easier. You will learn about building IaaS solutions to support SQL Server as well as managing Platform as a Service offerings like Azure SQL Database.

Designing your Azure infrastructure properly from the beginning is extremely important. An improperly designed and configured infrastructure will provide performance problems, manageability problems, and can be difficult to resolve without downtime.

As Azure scales around the world many more companies, no matter where they are located, will be begin moving services from on-premises data centers into the Azure Cloud, and a solid foundation is key to successful migrations

## Title: DevOps: Consistent Deployments / Team Development
 
**Abstract**:
Unless you are developing code by yourself, you face challenges of working with several team members. Different people are changing code which affects the code someone else is working on. In addition, there will be teams working on different projects at the same time.  In the middle of the projects, an emergency fix needs to be deployed to Production. So where is the code, when do you shared it with others, when do you get the code that has been shared, where is the production code branch located.  How do I branch and when do merge? How do I get a release branch? Let me share with you how we are handling this area of DevOps.

## Title: Back to Basics: SQL Server Configuration with dbatools and dbachecks
 
**Abstract**:
Automating the configuration of SQL Server instances and being able to check the configuration for standard configuration is an important role for any DBA when you have lots of instances.  But how can we automate the configuration easily?  How can we check to make sure the proper configuration is in place and hasn’t changed?

In this session, we will look at how to configure your SQL Server Instances using PowerShell and the dbatools module.  Then we will look at how to use dbachecks to confirm the configuration of our instances and how to check for changes in the future of the configuration.  

Attendees will see how easy it to use PowerShell via dbatools to configure their SQL Server instances.  Attendees will see how easy it is to use PowerShell via dbachecks and PowerBI to see if their servers are configured properly.  Attendees will be given a set of scripts that take back to use to configure and test the configuration of their SQL Server instances.

## Title: 3 Ways for Getting Data from SharePoint : SSIS, Excel and Access
 
**Abstract**:
Need to report on some data from SharePoint? We will look at three different techniques to pull data from a SharePoint Server. We will start with SSIS and the SharePoint List Source and Destinations. Next, We will use Excel to connect to various SharePoint lists (both online and on premise), and finally We will use Microsoft Access to do the same thing (and throw in the capability to do updates as well). At the end of the talk, We will have three different ways to get data from SharePoint.

## Title: Visualize Your Transaction Log
 
**Abstract**:
The SQL transaction log can be a mystery to many DBAs.  We live in the age of visualizations, so let's visualize the log!  In this session, we will examine the purpose and organization of the transaction log and will explore the log through a unique visualization tool.  We will consider common performance issues that are related to the logging mechanism and how to overcome these problems.  Finally, we will discuss some techniques to monitor the log so that potential performance problems can be addressed pro-actively.

## Title: Automated SQL Server installation and configuration using PowerShell  JSON
 
**Abstract**:
Using the SQL setup wizard and management studio (SSMS) to install and configure a new SQL server is a time-intensive process.  PowerShell scripts can greatly reduce the time required to complete the process.  They can also ensure build standardization throughout your SQL environment.  In this session we will look at using PowerShell scripts and JSON parameter files to automate the installation and post-install configuration of a SQL Server.

## Title: What You'll Love in SQL Server 2019
 
**Abstract**:
Technology moves at a blinding pace and the SQL Server platform is no exception.  With the release of SQL Server 2019, you will see some great improvement in the database engine of the platform.  In this session, you will examine some of the new features of SQL Server 2019 such as  Accelerated Database Recovery (ADR), resumable index creation, UTF-8 support, online columnstore rebuilds, an improved data truncation message, among other features.  After this session you will have a better understanding how you can leverage SQL Server 2019 to enhance your database environment.

## Title: SQL Server and Docker
 
**Abstract**:
Containers are everywhere.  If server virtualization dominated the past decade, then this one belongs to the containers.  Name any product, and the chances are there is a container image of that product ready to be deployed at a moment's notice.  Containers can be used for hosting any type of application, and in this session, we'll take a look at what you need to know to get started with containers with respect to SQL Server (2019, 2017 and prev versions), and address some of the common questions that come up during this setup.

He's been a Director and later VP of IT at several startups including PowerOne Media, TownNews and Traffiq and now consults. These days, when he's not busy with playing with SQL Server or spending time with his family, he can often be found underground caving or teaching cave rescue with the NCRC.
While his focus is on the operations side of DBA, his interests include DR, performance and general IT problem solving.
He is the author of: IT Disaster Response: Lessons Learned in the Field.
