## Title: Unraveling Tangled Code:A Spellbinding Tale of Victory Over Chaos
 
**Abstract**:
Once upon a time, you inherited an application or a database that was filled with chaos and inconsistencies. The T-SQL code is overly complex and impossible to ken. The architecture is painful to behold, and grueling to code for. One might optimistically say that query performance is “spectacularly mediocre”. If you’re without good documentation or system architects to guide you, how do you break the curse of confusion? In this session you’ll learn several methods for conquering chaotic code, and how to seek and destroy some of the nastier coding mistakes and inefficiencies. We will break complicated queries into key pieces, turn them upside-down, and reform them into something sensible. We will vanquish major issues like data abuse and index negligence. We will restructure joins, tame subqueries, and refactor dynamic SQL. We will emerge victorious!

## Title: Table Vars and Temp Tables – What you NEED to Know!
 
**Abstract**:
Almost every SQL Developer is familiar with Table Variables and Temporary Tables. While each of these objects represents temporary storage, there are also substantial differences between them. Understanding the differences between Table Variables and Temporary Tables, and the ramifications that those differences cause, is essential to being able to properly select the appropriate object for use in your development tasks. In this code filled session, we’ll discover the differences and similarities of Temporary Tables and Table Variables, dispel some widespread myths about each, and answer the most important questions of them all, "When do I use one or the other and what are the various impacts of doing so?"

## Title: SS2014/2016 In-Memory Tables --Formula One Performance Unleashed???
 
**Abstract**:
Query performance is what it is all about.  SQL Server 2014 now has the new in-memory functionality that takes a completely different approach to data access and manipulation.  This session will consolidate the relevant information from all these sources so the production DBA/Developer will be able to understand, create, use, maintain, and trouble-shoot in-memory table functionality.  This session will also examine several demo scripts showing performance gains using the in-memory tables with and without columnstore indexes over equivalent disk based tables.  
This session is all about when and how to apply in-memory tables in a production environment.
After this session you will
1.	 Understand what in-memory tables are and how to create and maintain them including their limitations
2.	Be able to identify performance gains over equivalent disk back tables
3.	Comprehend the new data monitoring needed for in-memory table

## Title: Tips for SQL Server Performance and Resiliency
 
**Abstract**:
After working 20 years in the industry on hundreds of SQL Servers clear patterns emerge. These observations of patterns and best practices directly relate to the health of the server.#160; During this session we will review the patterns of healthy SQL Servers and identify unhealthy behavior that clearly shows servers that are at risk.#160;
We will review shared patterns, configuration and practices.#160;#160; Which of these repeating patterns represent healthy Servers and which of these patterns are#160; shared with servers that are having issues daily.#160;
These patterns are so clear in fact that I many SQL Servers will benefit from the application of at least one if not more of the tips we will cover.#160; At the end of this session attendees will have the tools to identify and correct common issues that impact SQL Servers Performance and Resiliency.

## Title: Successfully Migrate Existing Databases to Azure SQL Database
 
**Abstract**:
Peoples first impressions have a long lasting effect. This is true, regardless if the first impression is related to technology or not.  Last thing you want to do is leave a bad first impression by having an unsuccessful migration to Azure SQL Database. 

In this session, you will learn how to test migrations for compatibility issues before you start the migration process. This will proactively eliminate road blocks during the migration process.  You will learn what tools are available to make sure migrations successfully meet your existing service level agreements. Finally, you will learn which performance tier is a good starting point for your existing workload and how to monitor your workload to make sure your users have a great experience while you save as much money as possible.

## Title: Profiler is Dead! Long Live Extended Events!
 
**Abstract**:
Did you know that Profiler and SQL Trace are deprecated? I know it still works, but it will never be updated with the latest features. In fact it will never be updated at all! That means if you want to capture information about any new feature, from version SQL Server 2012 and beyond, you need to use another tool.
That new tool is Extended Events (XE). Not only has it replaced Profiler, and can be used to capture information on all new features, but it is a substantially better tool!
In this session we will discuss the architecture of Extended Events, how to setup a new trace from scratch or convert an existing Profiler trace, and the new abilities that never existed in Profiler. We will also cover the difference in overhead cost of Profiler and Extended Events. 
Profiler was a friend of mine, but it is time to embrace the new king!

## Title: Reporting Services 2016: New Features  Smart Migration Strategy
 
**Abstract**:
With the release of SQL Server 2016, Reporting  Services is finally getting some love!  In this session you will get a brief peek at some of the new features and functionality including a look at the new Report Manager interface and the new control we have over the parameter placement on screen.

We will then dive into how to use a custom report, based on the ReportServer database transaction log table, to see which reports are actually being used and use that report to determine a smart strategy for which reports to migrate to a new 2016 installation.  You will see how to combine this understanding of active reports with the power of linked reports to simplify your Reporting Services implementation as you convert to SQL Server 2016.

The session will conclude with a look at my “Ultimate Footer”, which you can use on any version of Reporting Services, that shows report utilization, performance details, stored procedures and data sets used and discover any inline TSQL being abused.

## Title: Create a Data Loading Strategy
 
**Abstract**:
Loading large amounts of data into SQL Server can be challenging. Many factors may challenge your goal for tuned performance. To make the decision making process more difficult, many of the choices listed below have both Pros and Cons to their implementation. For this reason, bulk loading large amounts of data requires a strategy.

Create a strategy to optimize your massive data loading processes.
•	High Performance Data Loading
•	Minimal Logging and Bulk Loading
•	Indexing Considerations
•	Delayed Durability
•	Eager Write

This session uses a Virtual Sandbox to demonstrate “real” data loads using these techniques listed above. We will look at the T-SQL used in these data loads. We will briefly discuss how the different settings and configurations effect the data loads. Power Point slides and sample SQL will be provided.

## Title: Understanding Storage Systems and SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
The most important part of your SQL Server is also the slowest, Storage. This talk will take you through the fundamentals of your server's Disk I/O System. This session should give you a solid foundation over storage systems and help you understand why they are slow and how to overcome some of their limitations. We will cover the basics of computer systems, hard disks and disk controllers. Next, we will move to the fundamentals of RAID and how to configure your arrays for performance and reliability. Later, we will discuss the relationship between SQL Server and the file system, what is required for SQL Server and how to configure the file system for optimal performance. Finally, we will touch on how to monitor the performance and health of your storage system with some real world scripts that you can apply to your own environment. Along the way we will touch on other storage mediums like SAN’s and Solid State Disks, covering some pitfalls, gotchas and personal stories from the field.

## Title: Be a DBA Army of One
 
**Abstract**:
Your team does all the SQL Server maintenance and auditing, but it really shouldn't take quite so much time. It would be nice to get on that new project that's coming up in Q3, or study up on SQL 2016, right?  
You definitely need MinionWare: Minion Backup, Minion Reindex, and Minion Enterprise.
Minion Backup and Minion Reindex are FREE standalone solutions for SQL Server backup and index maintenance. Each module has a simple installation, extensive logging, and multi-level configuration options. 
 
Our flagship product, Minion Enterprise (or as we call it, "ME"), is the SQL Server management solution you've been looking for.  ME lets you see your entire enterprise from a single location. It easily answers questions like, "What are the service accounts for all the production servers? Who has sysadmin access to any server? How how much disk space will I need to add to the QA servers next year? Are there any databases that haven't had a full backup this week?"

## Title: SQL Server Statistics – What Are The Chances?
 
**Abstract**:
For far too long, I thought that statistics only contained information on table row counts.  While they do contain that information, there is more to it than that.  In this beginner session, we’ll go over statistics – how they are created, the different types of statistics that exist, how they’re maintained and how the Query Optimizer uses them.  We will also touch on system tables and DMVs that will provide additional information on your statistics.  We'll also go over the cardinality estimator changes in 2014.  At the end of this session, you should have a better idea of how the query optimizer within SQL Server makes decisions on how to gather data.

## Title: Service Broker - Put Me In Coach
 
**Abstract**:
This session is an introduction to Service Broker basics and how you can use it to for an alternative to ETL, batch processing and other asynchronous operations. Service Broker allows you to process your data asynchronously in a single instance. It makes for  a near real time ETL process. 

We will start off with the basic components of Service Broker. Then use what we have learned to  configure it to process some real life data using American Football Plays on a single database deployment. In addition, we will then use Service Broker as a replication alternative to show the ETL capabilities using databases on two separate instances.

At the end of this session, you will have the knowledge to use Service Broker for batch processing, ETL or even an alternative to replication.

## Title: Imposter Syndrome: Are You Faking It  Will they Find Out?
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever thought to yourself  “All these people think I’m smarter than I really am" or "I really don’t know what I’m doing, they're going to figure out I'm a fraud!”  If yes, then you suffer from the Impostor Syndrome. And despite all the accomplishments, awards and accolades, you still doubt yourself. It’s rampant in the modern day tech workplace, and the fear will make you shrink back from opportunities. You dismiss praise. You overcompensate by working harder, being charming and demanding perfection from yourself. What would happen if you were released from this bondage, and kicked your impostor to the curb? In this session, learn 3 powerful techniques that can help to improve your confidence and silent that annoying voice in your head!

## Title: Why Should I Care About … The Plan Cache
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this first installment of Rick’s “Why should I care” series a case for why working knowledge of how to query the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments, followed by a review of relevant DMV’s for the newly motivated audience. Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why their DBAs drink in the morning (allegedly). This is not a deep dive into the cache, it really is primarily a session exploring _why_ these DMVs are worth slogging through.

**Abstract**:
Performance troubleshooting is detective work. We'll have a lab system being assaulted by PowerShell scripts  (to simulate live users), and simulated performance problems like those that can make your on-call cell phone ring too much! Do you think you have what it takes to find these "needle in the haystack" issues and resolve them quickly?  This will be a highly interactive session where we will locate the rogue queries together, work through solutions, implement them and measure the results.  In this episode we'll focus primarily on improper indexing as a common underlying problem and all will walk away with much better troubleshooting skills and an upgraded knowledge of performance tuning!

## Title: SQL Server R Services in SQL 2016
 
**Abstract**:
One of the most exciting new features of SQL Server 2016 is the integration of the R statistical programming language into the platform with the brand-new SQL Server R Services.  In this introductory session we'll briefly introduce the R language and then look at how to install and administer SQL Server R Services.  We'll start to demonstrate the power of R by showing you how to create and run simple R scripts from within T-SQL.  We'll then discuss some of the powerful open source packages that are available to aid your data analyses.  Finally, we'll go through some examples of how to use R to integrate data analytical methods in real-world situations, and wow your customers with the power of statistics!

## Title: Recovery Models Made SIMPLE
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server always logs every change to a database. But exactly what is logged can vary based on a number of factors. Some operations are referred to as "minimally logged," but even those operations can log a different level of detail depending on your recovery model. This session looks inside the transaction log to see exactly what is logged for minimally logged operations. First, we look at some background information regarding how the log is used and managed, and then we introduce a tool that can help you actually see your log records. When you can query the log, you can determine how logging for operations such as index rebuilds and SELECT INTO differs depending on whether you are using the FULL or BULK_LOGGED recovery model. We also look at other factors in our SQL Server operations that can affect what is actually written to the log. In addition, I’ll describe the benefits and caveats for each of the recovery models.

## Title: Enterprise Row Level Security in SQL Server 2016 and Azure SQL DB
 
**Abstract**:
The need for organizations to provide Row Level Security (RLS) in their applications is increasing every day, often in existing applications where code changes are not easy. Microsoft has addressed this need in SQL Server 2016/Azure SQL DB with predicate based RLS.  


This session will show how organizational  asset hierarchies are leveraged together to provide predicate-based RLS on tables in SQL Server 2016/Azure SQL Database without application changes. This session will go beyond the basic RLS setups and show a real-world production setup of RLS using a small number of security records to secure large and small organizations. 


Attendees will leave with a complete working demo they can take to their work and begin to use immediately. The demo will walk completely through creating the database, creating the application tables and security related tables, loading demo and security data, setting up the RLS and testing the RLS using Power BI as a test application.

## Title: Introduction to Biml
 
**Abstract**:
Have you ever needed to generate dozens (or even hundreds) of similar SSIS packages? Do you ever find yourself needing to regenerate a lot of packages when some piece of the upstream data format changes? Using native SSIS, this can be a tedious and error prone exercise. However, using Biml (Business Intelligence Markup Language) can greatly increase your productivity as an ETL developer.

In this session, we'll cover the essentials of Biml. I'll discuss what it is and what it can do for SSIS, demonstrating how it can easily generate dozens or even hundreds of packages in just a few minutes. I'll also demonstrate some realistic examples and discuss how Biml fits into the enterprise ETL picture.

## Title: Polybase and Time Travel (Temporal Tables)
 
**Abstract**:
"With the release of SQL Server 2016, Microsoft has included two features that could fundamentally change the way we look at Data Warehousing.  The addition of Polybase for connecting to external data sources such as Hadoop and Azure Blob for native TSQL queries extends the reach of the DW.   The Temporal Table feature creates all kinds of possibilities for implementing Type 1 and 2 dimensions as well as time based reporting and logical data recovery.  In this session we will take an in depth lock at the features and scenarios for use.   We will also look at some actual demos of the technologies so you can get a feel for the technologies in action."

## Title: Scaling for best performance: Partitioned views.
 
**Abstract**:
Partitioning has long been one of the key feature sets utilized to improve performance or reduce contention within our large tables in SQL Server. However, table partitioning has been solely the prerogative of SQL Server Enterprise edition.  Even though that is correct, there are techniques available to us in Standard edition which would accomplish the same result as table partitioning. 

In this session we will go through the steps needed to configure and use the partitioned views to achieve the same result as table partitioning. We will also configure the maintenance jobs to imitate the sliding window functionality, and for those of us who are lucky to have Enterprise edition, we will see how to be able to take advantage of combining both partitioned views and table partitioning as well as inMemory tables to give us an ability to use double partition elimination based on two different keys as well as the ability to move hot spots data into inMemory OLTP.

## Title: SQL Security Best Practices  Shrinking Your Attack Surface
 
**Abstract**:
Every industry has a governing body or standard that requires some layer of security to your data. In my travels I have come to realize that when someone mentions security, DBA's tend to get frightened. This could be due to a lack of understanding of the requirements or not knowing what SQL Server offers to meet those requirements. In this session we will go over what SQL Server has to offer, Security Best Practices and how you can shrink your attack surface to meet Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of your Servers and Data.
