## Title: Being Smarter with Azure Machine Learning
 
**Abstract**:
Machine Learning is a subfield of computer science which is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Azure Machine Learning is a valuable tool that can be employed by data scientists with different skill levels. Azure ML also supports R and Python custom code, which can be dropped directly into your workspace. In this session, I will show a demo of using Azure ML with R. Audience will learn how a Microsoft Azure Machine Learning solution comes to life: From the creation of a workspace, to the preparation of data, to experimentation with machine learning algorithms, choose the right algorithm, and then finally to the integration of predictive insights.

## Title: Power BI; Amazing Things You Can Do
 
**Abstract**:
Power Query, Power View, and Power Pivot has been in the BI market for a while. Microsoft combined these three products into a single product and service with a new designer called Power BI Desktop (Power BI Designer). Power BI gathered features of these three products all in one, so building dashboards and effective visualization items with this tool is much easier nowadays. In this session you will learn all new and great features of Power BI. You will learn how to work with different data source, and apply Power Query transformation on them. You will learn tricks and tips of modelling with Power BI Desktop, and then how to visualize effectively with this tool. You will also learn how to build dashboards on Power BI website. At the end of this session you will be able to use Power BI for your everyday data analysis as well as organizational data mash up and visualization. So expect lots of demos in this session.

## Title: Myths and misconceptions
 
**Abstract**:
There are a great many theories, anti-patterns and just plain wrong ideas that people (mostly Devs, but including DBAs) believe about SQL Server. Yes, it’s enterprise ready. No, it doesn’t magically tune/tweak itself (it needs some lovin’ from time to time (just nowhere near as much as Oracle)). We’re going to look into debunking some of these falsehoods.
