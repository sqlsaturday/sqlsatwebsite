## Title: Analytics and the DBA – Using BI Power tools to visualize your SQL Infrastructure
 
**Abstract**:
DBAs do not always have time to work with some of the amazing visual data tools that are becoming common place now for analysts.  In this presentation I will show how in just a few very easy steps you can learn more than the basics of PowerView, PowerPivot and Data Mining using data you are already familiar with as a DBA, your SQL Server installation data. We will look at new and interesting way to load, transform, merge and analyze configuration and performance data for many servers simultaneously. I will also demonstrate how to best utilize that data for reports in Excel, SSRS and Visio to get the most out of automation, standardization and visualization with the new Power tools.
