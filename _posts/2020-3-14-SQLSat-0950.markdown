## Title: Using Columnstore indexes in Azure DevOps Services. Lessons learned
 
**Abstract**:
The Analytics service in Azure DevOps Services provides all-over insights to your DevOps data: work item tracking, CI/CD pipelines, testing process etc. 
	 
Built on top of columnstore indexes, the Analytics service has to deal with 100s of millions records and daily growth in 10s of millions, only a few minutes delay from operation store, sub second query performance for in-product experiences as well as 3rd party extensions, Power BI integration and ad-hoc queries.
	 
Working on it, I've learned a lot of DOs and DON'Ts about columnstore indexes. Session covers how to:
* partition columnstore indexes in a multitenant environment
* maintain columnstore indexes in case of updates and/or purge to keep segment elimination possible
* evolve database schema without downtimes and maintenance windows
* design to benefit from predicate and aggregation pushdown
* deal with edge case like ad-hoc queries for raw data and paging
* choose between CCI and NCCI based on usage patterns

## Title: Sponsored Session: Snowflake - The Modern Data Platform
 
**Abstract**:
Data is the new oil ! 
But just sitting on a patch of oil does not make one rich.  The oil needs to be drilled, extracted, refined and ultimately sold.
Same with data. Getting the right data in the hands of the right people in a timely manner seems to be more of a challenge than most organizations realize, and the reason for that is the limitations imposed by legacy on-premises and cloud v1.0 data warehouses.
Snowflake is a Modern Cloud Data Platform, rooted in the cloud, freeing you from those shackles and allowing you to use your data more efficiently, rather than spending all your time managing the underlying infrastructure and costs.
Come listen how Snowflake has enabled thousands of customers to make better, faster decisions, save money and discover new ways to use data! 
As a bonus, come learn how Snowflake enables customers to share relevant data in a modern, low-calorie way!

## Title: Sponsored Session: Redgate - Accomplishing DevOps with Redgate tools
 
**Abstract**:
Have you heard the recent industry noise about how people are applying DevOps principles to databases and wondered if it is just hype?

In this session, MVP Hamish Watson demonstrates how the noise is based on facts, and how using Redgate tools will make a huge (positive) difference to how you deploy changes to your SQL Server estate. The session is based on Hamish's experiences "in the wild" and lists all the benefits and pitfalls associated with applying DevOps principles to your database systems.

The session contains a demonstration, that is based on a real-world system. And after watching this session you will come away with practical methods of how to start your journey to DevOps brilliance.

## Title: Enabling Cloud Analytics with Azure Data Platform
 
**Abstract**:
Traditional DW solutions pre-date the cloud. They were designed to run on small, static clusters of well-behaved machines, making them a poor architectural fit. Сloud drives innovation. 

Organizations are moving away from on-premise analytics towards shared data centers and software-as-a-service solutions hosted by platform providers such as Microsoft Azure.

The shared infrastructure of the cloud promises increased economies of scale, extreme scalability and availability, and a pay-as-you-go cost model that adapts to unpredictable usage demands. 

Unfortunately, these advantages can only be captured if the software itself is able to scale elastically over the pool of commodity resources that is the cloud. 

This talk will cover the journey towards Modern Cloud Analytics Solutions with Microsoft Azure. 

This talk will help you understand the potential of Azure Cloud Analytics and learn about our use case and save time for future projects.

## Title: Special Agent Jenkins
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Agent is a powerful tool to configure scheduled tasks for your SQL Server. However, once this job is about to cross the boundary of the server itself - be it data collection, maintenance or administrative tasks or anything at all - Agent tasks become cumbersome, with complicated syntax and, usually, a mix of T-SQL, Powershell and xp_cmdshell.
This session will talk about an alternative to SQL Server Agent that allows us to orchestrate SQL Server environment in a more centralized manner and opens doors for advanced automation tasks, storing code in repositories and many more! Jenkins, one of the most popular DevOps tools, has a very forgiving learning curve and enables us to use thousands of community-inspired modules from one single point of entry. From Agent Jobs to Jenkins, or how to run your SQL code outside of the box.

## Title: Checking in with Power Apps, Flow and Power BI
 
**Abstract**:
In this session we will create an Power App that will allow users to check-in their location. We will then create a Flow that will take that location and write to a Power BI data source and refresh it. We will then create a Power BI report that will display the data on a map.

Power Apps is a great tool that allows you to create a desktop or mobile app with minimal coding. The app we are creating in this session uses the Bing location services to get the users location when a button is pressed. The Microsoft Flow we create in this session will take the location and user information and write it to an Excel file. We will also look at a custom connector in Flow that will allow us to refresh a Power BI data set. In the Power BI report we will create we will connect to an Excel file with the location information in it and display it in a report including the location on a map.

The audience will take away useful information about Power Apps, Flow and Power BI including all the code used.

## Title: A metadata approach to fixed width files
 
**Abstract**:
Face it, using SSIS to work with fixed width flat files is a pain.  The SSIS interface has you clicking around to mark each column. Then you use another interface to set each columns data types, etc.  And when you are done, you still need to document the file structure for your users.  What if you could simply document the file structure and then generate the ETL from the document?
To demonstrate such an approach, I build an Excel file describing US census data that has more than 300 columns of fixed width data.  After demonstrating how this file communicates to business users, I will generate an SSIS package from that metadata using BIML Script.  Then I will also look at how you can generate a SQL Server bulk insert format file from the same metadata.  A small amount of C# code can generate quite a large extract.

## Title: Become #TeamProfilerandXE 2020 Update
 
**Abstract**:
So when you started your career, you troubleshoot using profiler, got very comfortable with the interface and troubleshooting with it. Then in 2008, the SQL Server team came out with Extended Events. You tried it and said big TSQL scripts and XML shredding to get what I can get with profiler and a few button clicks and you really have never looked back. But really you still wonder if maybe just maybe I should be comfortable with this tool. 
During this basic session we will explore the features that differentiate XE from trace, with a focus on new features that have been recently released. 
After this session you’ll be comfortable creating your own XE sessions and will know when you use XE when to use profiler or when it doesn’t matter.

## Title: Why should I care about ... the plan cache?
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this installment of Rick's "Why should I care" series, he lays out a case for why working knowledge of the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments. A review of relevant views and functions is included for the (newly?) motivated audience.

Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why their DBAs often seem so frazzled. This is not a deep dive into the cache, it really is primarily a session exploring _why_ these DMOs are worth slogging through.

## Title: Strategic Management in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics
 
**Abstract**:
This is a workshop for beginners in the field of Business Intelligence and Data Analytics.
Data scientists should use the strategic management process to achieve strategic competitiveness and help the company achieve above-average returns. Strategic competitiveness on BI and Data Analytics is achieved when data scientists teams develop and implement a value-creating strategy at work. 
Those making strategic decisions must adopt a different mind-set, one that allows them to learn how to complete in highly turbulent and chaotic environments that produce a great deal of uncertainty. 
The effectiveness of the strategic management process at every level is increased when it is grounded in ethical intentions and behaviors.
Managing core competence (capability that is valuable, rare and costly to imitate) requires careful analysis of the company's resources and capabilities in their data scientist team. The knowledge of the company's human capital possesses is among the most significant o

## Title: Test Driven Development in SQL Server – how to deploy code safer
 
**Abstract**:
Test Driven Development (TDD)  is a design approach which has enabled application developers to write cleaner code. It is relevant for database development as it ensures that code produced using TDD and unit tests will be of higher quality which means interactions with data will be safer. 

TDD is not a new method of unit testing, it is an essential design practice for improving the quality of your deployed code.

In this session it will be shown how we can use TDD to design and write better unit tests using open-source frameworks and industry standard tools. These tools can be run within SQL Server Management Studio which means DBAs can also take advantage of TDD and unit test, to ensure more reliable code is deployed to databases. 
TDD can result in code that can be deployed more reliably and faster when using DevOps processes such as Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. 

A comprehensive DEMO will reveal how Test Driven Development can help you deploy database code

## Title: Prep Your Data for Analytics with R and Power BI
 
**Abstract**:
Data analytics, machine learning and statistical testing are all powerful tools for data science. These techniques all have one thing in common: the quality of the output is largely dependent on the quality of the data input! This session will walk through three scenarios of transforming and manipulating messy data to prepare for analytics. The data from each scenario will be shaped and cleaned with both Power Query in Power BI and tidyverse packages in R Studio. The techniques demonstrated in these examples can be transferred to prepare messy data from numerous other business scenarios!

His first exposure to SQL Server was as a database developer, but over time he became more and more interested in how the database engine operated... eventually specializing more on performance issues than code.

Rick will work with all things relational, but most enjoys helping smaller companies get better performance from MSSQL, as well as smoothing over relationships between DBA and development teams.
