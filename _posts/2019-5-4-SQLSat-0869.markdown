## Title: The Power of Data: The Complete Beginners Data Warehouse Kit
 
**Abstract**:
For many of us data is scattered in many different systems.  We almost all have data that someone wants to compare or track but can't without a lot of manual manipulation.  So, how do you tie disparate systems together? With a Data Warehouse! In this presentation you will get the skills you need to start building your own. We will discuss the basics of what a Data Warehouse is, the tools needed to create, deploy and manage the Data Warehouse process, and the benefits of using the data you collect to manage operational processes and create data visualizations. After attending this session you will be able to return to your job and amaze people with your ability to show them the power of the data!

## Title: Do Your Data Visualizations Need A Makeover?
 
**Abstract**:
Do you ever look at your data visualizations and feel that they are lackluster? Have you made a report using the latest chart types, but you still can’t gain adoption from your target audience? Lots of people feel this way, but they can’t quite identify what should be changed or how to change it. This session will help you identify signs that it’s time to give your data visualizations a makeover and provide practical tips for improving your reports and dashboards. We’ll discuss how simple changes in design choices related to color, chart types, chart formatting, and report layout can make a big difference in creating clear and engaging visualizations with common analysis tools like Power BI and Excel.

## Title: T-SQL Habits and Practices That Can Kill Performance
 
**Abstract**:
All too often we are on a project or given a task where the time or financial constraints require us to develop T-SQL “quick-and-dirty”. Or maybe we have been tasked with quickly improving the performance of some existing T-SQL. These situations often lead to code that later needs to be tuned for better performance. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could satisfy those tight time constraints while also avoiding many of the pitfalls that later plague performance?
In this session we will see ten common T-SQL writing habits that contribute to poor performance. We’ll see WHY each of these patterns can have such negative impact on performance, including examples, and we’ll see one or more alternatives for each that don’t have the same negative impact.
Armed with this knowledge, you will definitely impress your boss with your ability to create fast T-SQL within tight time constraints, and also quickly fix existing T-SQL code. Enjoy the merit raise you’ll get due to your new tuning talents.

## Title: Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere - Straight from the Source
 
**Abstract**:
Over the years, virtualization has matured from the exotic black magic realm to become a mainstream standard IT practice. quot;Virtualize Firstquot; is now a well-accepted default practice in most enterprises and any deviation is now considered an anomaly. In spite of this trend, many IT administrators and architects still have some reservations about virtualizing SQL Server workloads. They consider SQL too quot;criticalquot; to be virtualized; they wonder and worry about scale about performance; they are looking for guidance and reassurance. If this is where you (or your clients) are today, be sure to attend this session. You will gain valuable insights from what others have done to successfully undertake similar tasks in their environments. We will talk about configuration pitfalls to avoid and also review the configuration and current performance data for some of the most demanding applications in customers environments. Got an SQL virtualization or performance question? Bring i

## Title: Managing ETL Change using BIMLScript
 
**Abstract**:
You develop an SSIS package to load a flat file.  You meticulously identify each of the columns and map the columns to the target table.  Your package runs fine for months.  Then the file format changes.  It is back to the drawing board, selecting each column, setting the data types (type, length, etc.).  In many cases, you actually have the file structure in an electronic form.  Wouldn't it be nice to simply regenerate your SSIS package using that metadata? 

In this session I will demonstrate how to automate the generation of SSIS packages using the open source BIML and BIMLScript. 

I will then demonstrate how to use this technique to handle changes in file structure.  I will generate an SSIS package  from a simple Excel workbook I will represent the structure of a flat file and its relationship to a staging table.

Finally, I will use BIMLScript to handle changes from one version of SSIS to the next and from SSIS to Azure data factory.

## Title: SQL DevOps Simplified with Production Databases
 
**Abstract**:
DevOps is based on building an application binary (immutable artifact) that supports a highly reliable, repeatable engineering process.  In the case of SQL Server, however, a database is already in production, and isn’t simply replaced (as an app binary), but is upgraded.   Current SQL Server DevOps methods use source control to build a “development” database, with schema and objects and static data needed for functional testing.  "Near production data" is used in Staging, and finally production is upgraded.  This approach involves complexity, and breaks the principle of working with immutable artifacts throughout the process.  Our session introduces a new approach to SQL Server DevOps, with production databases used in all stages.   Production database clones are delivered more quickly than "built" databases, are more easily integrated with source control, and produces higher fidelity outcomes.  Learn how leading enterprises are simplifying SQL DevOps.

## Title: Environmental SQL Server Troubleshooting
 
**Abstract**:
When called in to diagnose a performance issue what are the 1st things you review? Many DBAs and developers make the mistake of diving straight into the code looking for an answer. However, often times the solution is not in the code but rather in the overall environment. Environmental troubleshooting is often a quick and overlooked method for discovering and configuring SQL Server to perform at a higher level without the need for application change controls.

In this session we will discuss both performance pitfalls and optimizations that can be made to the system outside of code changes. We will diagnose configurations commonly misapplied and review best practices in SQL Server, Windows Server, and VMware!

## Title: Containers: Crash course for SQL Server DBAs
 
**Abstract**:
Have you heard about these “Container” things? You may have questions like “What is a Container?”, Who is this “Docker?”, “Aren’t containers a Linux Thing?” and “As a DBA why do I care?” Sit back and listen as we cover these questions and many more. We will then take a closer look at leveraging Containers in a SQL world. We will review the published Microsoft SQL Server container images, what you can do with them and why you would want to use them. We will then show some examples of running MS SQL Server in a container on both a Windows host and a Linux host. This is a great introduction to Containers as well as what is possible with SQL Server in a container.

## Title: Real-World PowerShell for SQL Administration
 
**Abstract**:
If you're like me, you've attended PowerShell sessions before. However, much of the *practical* usage of PS comes with rolling back your sleeves and digging into the nuances of syntax and how to get things done.

In this session, I'm assuming that you know the basics of PowerShell. What we're going to cover are some of the "gotchas" and nuances that I've run into when I've been working with the language, and particularly with SQL's flavor of PowerShell.

And then we'll spend the bulk of our time looking at real-world, practical scripts that I use pretty much every day. PowerShell is an awesome way to automate so many processes and relieve some of the everyday monotony of SQL administration.

## Title: Get Your Optimizer to Give up All Its Secrets
 
**Abstract**:
You know that execution plans can provide you with vital information to tune a query, but just how does that plan get generated?  In this session, we will examine details the query optimization process that are not very well known.  We will discuss how SQL Server parses a T-SQL statement then and begins applying rules to make it more efficient.  Did you know that SQL Server can be coaxed into outputting hidden structures such as parse trees and memos?  We'll do just that, and then take it a step further with a unique visualization tool that I have created.  With a better understanding of how SQL Server optimizes T-SQL (and sometimes doesn't do it as well as might be hoped), you can write more efficient SQL statements.

## Title: SQL vs NoSQL: a Comparison of SQL vs MongoDB
 
**Abstract**:
Have you heard of NoSQL, but aren't really sure what it is? Are you wondering if you're missing out on something that could satisfy that complex data model problem you haven't found a good solution for?

We'll learn about the flavors of NoSql and then dig down into MongoDB, the NoSQL database that drives many websites. Then we'll get an overview of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) along with how and why it's used in NoSQL, focusing on its advantages and disadvantages.

You'll see how the SQL table structure compares to the NoSQL data structure. After that, we'll look at examples of storing the same data in both systems and how that data flows to the web page.

We'll discuss the factors that drive your choice of database along with the trade-offs involved. Then we'll wrap up by taking a look at Microsoft's on-premises and cloud efforts in the MongoDB NoSQL space.

**Abstract**:
At one of the non-profits (PCs for Refugees) I volunteer, we provide refugees with computers to help them learn English and other school subjects like Math, Science, etc. along with typical usage like ticket booking, navigation, communication, entertainment, etc.

In this session, I'll try to explain the benefits of Microsoft for Nonprofits sponsorship and how any cost-effective organization can use MS Forms (or such), Power BI, PowerApps and MS Flow to not only build a full-fledged solution but also how easy and cost-efficient it is to implement, maintain and expand it as necessary.

We will go over the implementation of a typical case management system which receives requests; visualize and plan logistics; take it through stages using mobile/web platforms; and keep everyone involved to be fully integrated and informed throughout the life-cycle of the request. We'll also touch upon the insights we used to shape up and optimize the delivery and effectiveness of the empowerment effo

## Title: Open Source vs SQL Database Maintenance Plans
 
**Abstract**:
The Database Maintenance plans used to be a one size fits all tool that did a lot of unnecessary work, especially, when it came to indexing. So I have been recommending that clients use other tools such as Ola Hallengren’s award winning free SQL Server Maintenance Solution. So let’s have a showdown at high noon in the Arizona desert and see if Database Maintenance Plans in SQL 2016 and 2017 are now good enough or if we still need to turn to other solutions like Ola’s.
