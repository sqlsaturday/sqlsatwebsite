## Title: Azure SQL Database-Business Continuity During Disaster
 
**Abstract**:
Azure SQL Database is a relational database-as-a-service (DBaaS) based on the latest version of the Microsoft SQL Server Database Engine. You can build data-driven applications and websites in the programming language of your choice, without needing to manage infrastructure. 

While considering Azure SQL Database, two of the most critical questions you need to answer are what are my options for business continuity and how to implement these options? 

In this demo intensive session, I will talk about five specific options and show you how to implement those. You will walk out of this session equipped with knowledge and scripts to implement appropriate High Availability and Disaster Recovery solutions for your Azure SQL Database.

## Title: Multi-server agent jobs administration with happy faces and pigeons
 
**Abstract**:
This talk will be about multi-server administration using MSX and TSX servers. Built-in feature you may have seen, but was too scared to play with. Will show you how to configure multi-server environment and how to manage it with least possible resources.

What SQL Server and pigeons have in common? Not much, besides that you do not want to be a pigeon – pigeon post to be specific.
I have been a DBA pigeon in my past. Managing hundreds of SQL Servers and visiting every single SQL Agent to setup the maintenance jobs, backup jobs or any jobs that would help me to keep the servers up and running. Sometimes using SQL scripts, other times Powershell scripts to deploy or update new jobs, but it was still the same ol’ way. Flying between instances like a bird. Until, one day, I found out about MSX and TSX! And now my life is full of happy faces! I want your face to be happy too.

In this session you will learn how easy is to setup this hidden and forgotten feature of SQL Server. Will show you
