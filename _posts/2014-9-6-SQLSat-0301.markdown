## Title: SQL Server Reporting Services 2014 on Steroids!!
 
**Abstract**:
Reporting requests that are required ‘yesterday or sooner’, oft times necessitate working more efficiently and effectively. We have all been through this at one time or another.
In this hands on presentation we shall be looking some of the more challenging techniques of extracting our data from our Multidimensional and Tabular Models, in addition to our Data Mining Models. 
We shall be utilizing concepts of  ‘Openquery()’ and ‘linked servers’ as a means to extract data,  in addition to looking at the way that these two concepts can help us extract our data utilizing MDX, DMX and DAX expressions;  AND YET maintain the  flexibility and the ability to utilize all those wonderful techniques that may  be done with T-SQL.

## Title: Database design for mere developers
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2012: Efficient and effective database design is so important that leaving it solely to the DBAs is simply not a solution. We as developers will more than likely have to create applications to access the data stores and as such must ensure that all application related considerations are taken into account within the database design.In this session, (aimed at software developers) we shall be touching upon several concepts of special importance to the developer. These include database development "patterns and anti-patterns", final proofing of design and creating versatile deployment scripts that can and will be utilized in future endeavors.

## Title: Custom Prompt Pages for Microsoft Reporting Services
 
**Abstract**:
When a client migrated from IBM Cognos to SQL Server Reporting Services as their reporting tool, we needed to provide the same functionality and user experience they were getting with the Cognos prompt pages. The standard Reporting Services prompt pages could not meet these requirements, so we developed and implemented a custom prompt page solution, using ASP, JavaScript and jQuery, from which to run the Reporting Services reports. This session will cover how we developed this solution and how it works.

## Title: SQLCLR Real World Usage
 
**Abstract**:
SQLCLR was introduced in SQL Server 2005 with much fanfare. Unfortunately the uptake of it was not as good as Microsoft would have wanted. This does not mean however that SQLCLR is not useful, it is very useful in the right circumstances. In this session we will see how to use SQLCLR and how it is being used in production to solve real-world hard problems. The session is high on code and low in slides!

## Title: Power BI in Office 365
 
**Abstract**:
In this session we will explore the power of Power QA in Office 365. We'll look at getting data into O365 enabling it for QA and then using Power QA on that data. We'll then switch to Sample Data available in Office 365 to demo some capabilities with a larger data set.

## Title: Indexing for performance
 
**Abstract**:
An effective indexing strategy is one of the most important responsibilities of a database professional. In this session we will briefly look at the internals of indexes and how the engine decides how to utilise them. We will explore the different options and choices available in the different versions from 2005, 2008,2012 and 2014.

## Title: UNIQUEIDENTIFIERs as Primary Keys in SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
UNIQUEIDENTIFIERs as Primary Keys in SQL Server - a good or bad best practice? They have a lot of pros for DEVs, but DBAs just cry when they see them enforced by default as unique Clustered Indexes. In this session we will cover the basics about UNIQUEIDENTIFIERs, why they bad and sometimes even good, and how you can find out if they affect the performance of your performance critical database. If they are affecting your database negatively, you will also learn some best practices how you can resolve those performance limitations without changing your underlying application.

## Title: On Transactions and Atomic Operations
 
**Abstract**:
If there’s one thing that we, as SQL developers, don’t do, it’s use enough transactions.
Transactions are critical when multiple changes need to be made entirely or not at all, but even given that it’s rare to see transactions used at all in most production code.

In this session, we’ll look at what transactions are and why we should use them. We’ll explore the effects transactions have on locking and the transaction log. We’ll investigate methods of handling errors and undoing data modifications, and we’ll see why nested transactions are a lie.
