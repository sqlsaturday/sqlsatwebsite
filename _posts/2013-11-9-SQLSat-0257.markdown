## Title: Monitoring MDX Queries in Analysis Services
 
**Abstract**:
If you are able to answer to questions like “How many people use your OLAP solution?”, “How many MDX queries are performed daily on your Analysis Services instances?”, “What is the average response time of an MDX query on your servers?” THIS SESSION IS NOT FOR YOU!!!
Otherwise, in this session we will see how is it possible to implement a monitoring tool using resources already available on our servers such as PowerShell, SQL Server Profiler, Reporting Services, and simple XMLA commands.
Finally, we will see how further enrich the presented solution providing also the ability to identify the most problematic MDX queries, run performance measures on them and obtain a summary report that identifies any bottlenecks specifying whether they reside in the Storage or Formula Engine of Analysis Services 
All this in a fully automatic way!
The solution presented is currently being used successfully by SolidQ at some customers in Italy.

## Title: Hardware Planning  Sizing for SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
L'acquisto di un server dedicato a SQL Server è ancora un'operazione necessaria. Il cloud è un'ottima scelta ma se dovete creare un datawarehouse di dimensioni non banali o se avete la necessità di avere performance e controllo ottimali del vostro database server di produzione, la scelta del server on-premise è ancora quella vincente.Il problema è quindi: come non buttare via soldi in hardware inutile? In questa sessione vedremo come tutti i componenti concorrono nel formare un hardware bilanciato (questa è la parola chiave!) e senza colli di bottiglia, massimizzando l'investimento fatto. Parlaremo di SAN, CPU, HBA, Fiber Channel, Memoria e tutto quello che pensavate di conoscere bene...

## Title: xVelocity Columnstore Indexes in SQL Server 2012 and SQL 2014
 
**Abstract**:
With the release of SQL Server 2012, Microsoft introduced a new type of nonclustered index called xVelocity columnstore index in the SQL Server database engine. It is based on VertiPaq in-memory data compression technology. The xVelocity memory optimized columnstore indexes are one of the most significant performance and scalability enhancements in SQL Server 2012, and more in SQL 2014. The xVelocity columnstore indexes speed up the processing time for common data warehousing queries -- particularly in situations where very large quantities of data have to be aggregated and accessed quickly.

## Title: SQL Server Security in an Insecure World
 
**Abstract**:
One of the first responsibilities of a SQL Server DBA is to safeguard the data and protect it from unauthorized access. 
Over and over we hear about hacker attacks and data leaks: if you don't want  to be the next victim, you have to take action and activate all the available protection measures.
In this session you'll learn how to secure your SQL Server infrastructure and how to take advantage of the numerous security features available in the product.

## Title: Useful everyday tips and tricks for Reporting Services
 
**Abstract**:
Reporting Services è uno strumento molto potente e permette di creare report anche complessi in breve tempo. L'esperienza di sviluppo, però, presenta a volte alcuni "spigoli" che possono creare qualche problema e allungare i tempi di realizzazione nel tentativo di trovare una soluzione girovagando tra MSDN e i forum più disparati. Questa sessione vuole fornire una serie di trucchi e consigli, dettati dall'esperienza diretta sul campo -e da molti caffè-, che si sono rivelati utili a limare tali spigoli.

## Title: Node.js on SqlServer
 
**Abstract**:
We are used to connect to a Sql Server database from our .NET applications with ADO.NET, but today new possibilities are available. Node.js is a new web framework suited for high scalable web applications. Microsoft has released on github the driver to build node.js applications that use SqlServer as a storage. During the session we will see what is node.js and how it can be used with SqlServer.

## Title: Gestione degli errori nel codice T-SQL 
 
**Abstract**:
Tra i vari miglioramenti 
 dell?engine c’è quello relativo alla gestione degli errori 
 direttamente da T-SQL. Il nuovo costrutto throw, totalmente aderente 
 alla Xact_abort, consente una migliore gestione degli errori che 
 potrebbero verificarsi nell?engine di SQL server, siano essi sollevati dall?utente o da operazioni non lecite. L’importante è
scrivere codice T-SQL in grado di gestire le anomalie e fare in modo 
 che le nostre applicazioni lo richiamino E che interpretino correttamente i risultati.

## Title: Put database under source control
 
**Abstract**:
We are used to see our code under source control. What about our databases? This topic is too often underestimated. Keeping database under our control (source controlled) brings many advantages in terms of organization and quality. The distributed work become rock solid and Continuous integration is simpler to implement. In addition, we can take many advantages from testing, automated deployment and all the stuff that brings the agile methodology available to the team.

## Title: Agile SSIS with Biml
 
**Abstract**:
Are you tired to waste your time in a “monkey work” spent in SSIS packages? Are you tired to fight against packages' corrupted metadata and side effects due to abrupt changes in metadata? It's time to get in touch with Biml, a new player in the Microsoft BI realm. We’ll see how Biml can help us in a BI project, automating the ETL packages' development. In particular, we’ll see it in action in the Staging phase of the project.

## Title: Temporal Data in SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Although temporal data is part of many business applications, most RDBMS’, including SQL Server, do not support it out of the box. However, SQL Server provides full infrastructure to build your own temporal data support. After introduction of temporal problems, we are going to develop interval CLR data type that supports validity time. Then we are going to discuss what kind of constraints pertain to temporal data, and how we can implement those constraints. We are going to use T-SQL to develop two very useful temporal operators: PACK and UNPACK. In addition, we are going to introduce the proposed sixth normal form that deals with temporal data, and show how you can implement it correctly.

## Title: Exploring In-memory OLTP Engine (Hekaton) in SQL Server 2014 CTP1
 
**Abstract**:
The continuing drop in the price of memory has made fast in-memory OLTP  increasingly viable. SQL Server 2014 allows you to migrate the most-used tables in an existing database to  memory-optimised 'Hekaton' technology, but how you  balance between disk tables and in-memory tables for optimum performance requires judgement and experiment. What is this technology, and how can you exploit it? This session will try to explains.

**Gilberto Zampatti**
 
Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…
