## Title: Dimensional Modeling 101
 
**Abstract**:
So many names! Data warehouse, data mart, star-schema, snowflake schema, dimensional model, Type 1, Type 2, Type 3... What does it all mean?  Whether you're a data consumer, ETL specialist, or database designer, it pays to understand the vocabulary and design concepts of dimensional models.  In this session, we'll cover the basics of dimensional modeling, including dimensions, facts, and the ways they all come together.  We'll talk about why denormlization isn't necessarily a dirty word, some common design challenges, and a few ETL considerations.  By the end of the hour, you'll be ready to impress your friends and confound your frenemies with your mad dimensional modeling knowledge!

## Title: Data Quality Services--Finally!
 
**Abstract**:
Every organization that stores data stores dirty data, and suffers with how best to handle this unpleasant fact.Organizations must rely on people to deal with data problemseither by paying them to clean it or paying them to work around it. Either way it is costly and only becomes more so over time. Finally with the release of SQL Server 2012, there is a tool to help. Learn how to use the key parts of Data Quality Services: how to create Data Cleansing Knowledge Bases to cleanse data both in the DQS client and inside SSIS 2012, and how DQS Matching Knowledge Bases can integrate with Master Data Services for de-duplication of data. Session focuses on DQS, but also explains how DQS, MDS, and SSIS work together.

## Title: Conquer Reporting By Scaling Out SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
In this session I will go over how to separate your systems for transactional databases, and for reporting.  I will lightly cover how this can be done with mirroring, replication, which one is right for your situation.

## Title: Automating SSIS Development with Biml
 
**Abstract**:
SSIS is a great tool for transferring data from one data source to another, and for implementing complex ETL processes. However, there are some painful shortcomings that make it difficult to automate package creation, easily reuse patterns and templates, and create packages directly from schema information and other metadata.  The free and open source BIDS Helper Add-In offers support for automatically generating SSIS packages using the Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml). 
In this session we will start by showing the power of Biml.  We will then step back, and start from the beginning of using BimlScript.  Once we cover the basics, we will cover practical examples using the BIDS Helper add-in to automate SSIS development.

## Title: Tame Your Unruly Data...With Constraints!
 
**Abstract**:
Never given time or care, never forming good relationships, becoming bloated, corrupt and rife with indistinguishable copies, and all so horrifyingly pervasive in society. But enough about the Kardashians, what about YOUR DATA? If you want to straighten it out and prevent it from going too far in the first place, this session is for you. We will cover constraint basics (not null, check, primary key/unique, foreign keys), provide standard use cases, and address misconceptions about constraint use and performance. We will also look at triggers and application logic and why these are NOT substitutes for (but can effectively complement) good constraint usage. Attendees will enjoy learning how to keep THEIR data off the tabloid page!

## Title: Expanding Productivity Using BI Data Visualization
 
**Abstract**:
There are a multitude of data visualization options in a Microsoft environment, Reporting Services, Excel Services,  Performance Point, Power View, 3rd party tools...each of these are specialized tools to fill a specialized need.  In this session we will walk through each of these tools.  Focusing on the most popular tool Excel, we will see how we can take this already excellent tool and extend its capabilities further   At the end of the session the attendee will understand the range of data visualization options and how they can use Excel to design reports for both multidimensional, tabular, and relational models for an enhanced user experience on the PC, Web, and Mobile devices.

## Title: Pretty Output: T-SQL for Presentation
 
**Abstract**:
So you've got your data in the database? That's great!  Now... how about getting it back out?  Sometimes complex reports call for complex queries, and this session is all about that.  Want to pivot your rows into columns?  Sure.  Want to format that self-referencing hierarchy?  Got it.  Ranking? Windowing? No problem.  In this session we'll cover some common data formatting issues and the T-SQL solutions that make them a little less scary.

## Title: Deeper into Tabular Models -  M-to-M and the "W"
 
**Abstract**:
You will need to understand how many-to-many relationships work in tabular models. While different than dimensional models, you can be successful in getting many of the behaviors you will need. Understanding how filters propogate is necessary requisite. We will use a "W" diagram to understand how this occurs in tabular models. Then will will learn how to force filter propogation called cross-filtering. The we will cross-filter conditionally, based on what the user has chosen for filters. If time permits we will also learn how to handle large numbers of fact rows, both in development and production.

## Title: Prototype with PowerPivot: External SSAS Groups
 
**Abstract**:
Once the enterprise implements SSAS, immediate reporting benefits appear as the power of OLAP is unleashed in the speed of aggregations, the support of organization-wide ad hoc analysis and reporting, and myriad other advantages. A common need that then often arises is the capability to perform extra-hierarchy groupings. In this session, BI Architect and MVP Bill Pearson presents an approach to accomplishing external grouping with PowerPivot. We examine ways to accomplish a stated, example business need for such grouping via the addition of PowerPivot to an integrated Microsoft BI solution. Moreover, we discuss ways to design a scalable solution with PowerPivot that we can then entrain into the base warehouse / mart / cube structure.

The start of data driven design and programmatically creating packages, scan an entire BIDS Solution all cubes, dimensions, and connections in SSAS using Analysis Management Objects (AMO) with C#. This allows us to create a metadata mart and full documentation of our SSAS cubes.

## Title: SSIS Package Realtime Visualzation  Analytics
 
**Abstract**:
Implement an SSIS Framework to track the progress of  SSIS production packages similar to how you can in the BIDS Designer, and explore your package withs  windows explorer like capability.Utilizing  the “out of the box” SSIS Logging with no changes required to the existing  logic or packages. The new framework  will also use SSIS to scan existing packages and automatically discover Master / Child package relationships and providing a capability for package restartability. This design pattern can be use to replace earlier “Stored Proc” version of SSIS Framework greatly reducing the code required. This functionality is complementary to the 2012 Package Tracking capability.
