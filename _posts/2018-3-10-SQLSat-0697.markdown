## Title: Basics of Database Corruption Repair
 
**Abstract**:
Your database is running fine month after month with no problems. Suddenly someone reports that their query won’t run. They get an error stating “SQL Server detected a logical consistency-based I/O error“, or something even scarier. Do you know what to do now? We will walk through 3 corrupt databases exploring ways to go about finding and fixing the corruption. More importantly we will explore how to prevent further data loss at the time corruption occurs. Learn what things you can do to protect yourself when corruption strikes. Learn how to avoid making things worse, and how to protect your data if things do get worse. You will leave with a checklist of steps to use when you encounter corruption. By the end of this session you will be ready to take on corruption, one database at a time.

## Title: Oracle vs. SQL Server Indexing-  The Good, the Bad and the Ugly
 
**Abstract**:
This session is based off research performed on objects, design and code built to be as similar as possible to see how Oracle and SQL Server compare in performance, usage and storage of indices.  Based off trusted measurements in each platform, we’ll dig into how the use case was built, the similarities and the differences in each.  What we can admire about how each product has matured in the way of managing index data, statistics and how the optimizer hinders and enhances index availability.

Takeaways are:
1.	Receive a strong education on platform differences between Oracle and SQL Server.
2.	Discover hidden insight on index storage and costs.
3.	Learn about great tips on maintaining index health and how one platform may perform better than the other and how.
4.	Translation of common features in both platforms

## Title: Move Your SQLServer Database to "The Cloud" With Almost Zero Downtime
 
**Abstract**:
In this presentation, we’ll review “What is ‘the Cloud’” and then describe the different methods you can use to migrate your on-premise SQLServer databases into this new environment.  We’ll cover migrations to both infrastructure and database as a service.   We’ll describe in detail how the use of a database replication tool can help you migrate your databases to the cloud with almost no downtime, and reduce the risk of data loss.  We’ll also show you how you can use replication after migration to keep on-premise and cloud databases synchronized, which can help you migrate to the cloud in phases, rather than all at once.

## Title: DevOPs and the DBA
 
**Abstract**:
You may have heard the word "DevOps" and wondered whether it is just another buzzword and/or what it can do for you.

In this session I will demystify the concepts of DevOps and we will look at two aspects of DevOps - Continuous Integration  Continuous Delivery.

Continuous Integration is the practice in which software developers frequently integrate their work with that of other members of the development team.It also involves automating tests around the integrated work

​Continuous Delivery is the next step after Continuous Integration in the deployment pipeline and is the process of automating the deployment of software to  test, staging, and production environments.

Database migrations/changes are an area that may not be typically automated or utilise Continuous Delivery.

Through the use of a comprehensive live demo to a running database hosted in Azure the audience will learn the benefits and how to implement Continuous Delivery in their database systems deployment pipeline.

## Title: Becoming a Master by Giving it All Away
 
**Abstract**:
It has been said that novices absorb knowledge like a sponge, intermediates hoard it for themselves, and masters just simply give it away.  
The community spirit of PASS is for like-minded professionals to interact and share knowledge.  But how do you do this in your own workplace?  What happens when Bob takes off with one day of notice?  How do you manage when Jane unfortunately has to spend a month in the hospital?
All joking aside, the only way to truly become a master at your craft is to share your precious knowledge with your peers and workmates.  We will discuss past and current trends in knowledge transfer, the reasons why you should (and shouldn’t) pass on knowledge, and methods for making this happen in your workplace and in your life.
Be prepared for an interactive and lively discussion and to walk away with some new concepts that are going to make you think about how you too can become a Master!

## Title: Azure Data Catalog – Turning Unused Assets into Usable Knowledge
 
**Abstract**:
Data is today’s currency. Azure Data Catalog (ADC) is a relatively unknown resource in the IT community.  This is an unfortunate state since ADC is an incredibly useful tool that is easy to implement and use. Companies that are able to leverage their data have seen the greatest gains in growth and market capitalization.  The reason for this is simple: We live in the information age.  Being able to leverage the data you gather is the invitation you need just to compete in information age.
ADC is an indispensable tool that helps companies organize and make sense of the mountains of data they collect every day.  By walking participants through an implementation of ADC, I will introduce them to the product, and show how easy it is to use.  By presenting concrete examples of how ADC is used, I will demonstrate its importance. Participants should leave this session determined to introduce ADC to their team and resolute in their intention to implement it within their company.

## Title: Magical Memory Moments
 
**Abstract**:
OR, How In-Memory Objects Can Supercharge Your Data And Bring About World Peace 

OK, so you’ve been reading about, perhaps even testing out some of the ‘in-memory’ objects now available in SQL Server. Some of the claims are exciting, and some seem overly optimistic. And Yet, you want to know, experience more … Perhaps your situation doesn’t really call out for in-memory tables. But you should consider memory-optimized #Temp tables, memory-optimized table variables, and natively compiled stored procedures.It’s true. Using memory-optimized tables requires a little more fore-thought, a bit more care, even a few configuration tweaks.
• But what are the real advantages of memory-optimized objects?
• What are the memory-optimized objects you can use?
• How can you best use memory-optimized objects?
In this demo packed session, we will discuss the pros and cons of using memory-optimized objects in ways that will supercharge your SQL Server.

## Title: Securing SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
A default SQL Server installation is reasonably secure, but quot;reasonably securequot; doesn't cut it in an era in which one bad line of code, one weak password, or one open port can result in your customer database ending up on Pastebin. In this talk, we will look at different methods of securing a SQL Server instance, from venerable (principle of least privilege, Transparent Data Encryption) to novel (Always Encrypted, row-level security). These tools and techniques will show us ways for developers, database administrators, and network specialists to work together to secure SQL Server instances.

He was sent down with a copy of UNIX for Dummies and 50 cents for the bus ride back.  Fast forward a few years, he was asked if he wanted to be a DBA after successfully managing a fifty server Y2K upgrade.  Since then, he’s never looked back and has survived a number of data and system challenges.
