## Title: Disaster Recovery and High Availability in Azure SQL Database
 
**Abstract**:
While Azure SQL Database does have built-in safety mechanisms, these are not always well understood. Further, a good architect will ensure redundancy even with an already protected system. This session will show how Azure SQL Database is built and maintained by Microsoft to provide protection for your production information. We’ll also go over methods you can employ to add additional protection to your systems. Moving to the cloud and taking advantage of all that it offers doesn’t mean your data is automatically, fully protected. The knowledge from this session will help to ensure a higher degree of safety, faster recovery, and more up-time for your Azure SQL Databases.

## Title: Dynamic SQL: Tables, Pivots, Parameters  More
 
**Abstract**:
Dynamic SQL is a scripting language that helps you design flexibility into your code. It allows you to design solutions, pass parameters and allows you build a single query on values passed.  Dynamic SQL has both pros and cons to it's design, but can also be a helpful tool. This presentation will walk through the steps of building dynamic tables, aggregating data in a pivot format and give you the first steps of writing a Dynamic Query.  We will also see how to use Dynamic SQL to build multiple databases across servers, alter a single table in multiple servers and add columns to a table, all through the magic of Dynamic SQL.

## Title: Get TurnedOn with AlwaysOn
 
**Abstract**:
Once upon a time, there were 2 SQL Solutions named High Availability and Disaster Recovery. They had a love hate relationship and could never find a common ground. That is, until SQL Server 2012 brought them together in a love story built for the ages. When the dust settled, a beautiful new feature was born. It was called AlwaysON and brought with it new technologies like availability groups, read-only mirrors and listeners. It was a perfect blend of both HA and DR all wrapped up in one bundle of joy. 
SQL Server AlwaysOn provides a high-availability and Disaster-recovery solution for SQL Server 2012. Come see and learn some of the new features associated with it, how they work and why this new feature of SQL Server 2012 is so wonderful.

## Title: Always Encrypted for Beginners
 
**Abstract**:
One of the biggest challenges to successful implementation of data encryption has been the back and forth between the application and the database.  You have to overcome the obstacle of the application decrypting the data it needs.  Microsoft tried to simplify this process when it introduced Always Encrypted (AE) into SQL Server 2016 and Azure SQL Database.  In this demo intense session, you will learn about what Always Encrypted is, how it works, and the implications for your environment. By the end you will know how to now easily encrypt columns of data and just as importantly how to unencrypt. You will also learn about the current limitations of the feature and what your options are to work around them.

## Title: CozyRoc: Dynamic Data Flows in SSIS Without Programming
 
**Abstract**:
This session is an introduction to the unique functionality offered by COZYROC to create integration packages that dynamically map columns at runtime. The standard SSIS Data Flow Task can only use static metadata which is defined when the package is initially designed. The mapping of columns is configured and remains unchanged until the package is re-opened and design changes are made, thus costing maintenance time and effort. Data Flow Task Plus extends the capabilities of the standard Microsoft Data Flow task in that it allows you to set up dynamic data flows, thus eliminating maintenance time and effort. Changes to tables and columns are automatically incorporated at run time without the need to change and redeploy the package. Columns and fields are mapped automatically at run time. Furthermore, the initial design time and effort may be greatly reduced when dealing with huge amounts of data in a large number of files and/or databases.

## Title: Delivering Business Value Faster
 
**Abstract**:
Every team’s goal is to deliver business value faster, the question is how do you do that? If you’re a small shop with 1 or 2 developers then writing script in test and then running them production may be okay, but for a larger team that leads to problems. Using continuous integration (CI) and deployment techniques you can make small incremental changes which then set off a chain of automation steps that validates the new code. After automated validation, the code changes are ready for any additional User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and staging environments. During this session, you will learn how to manage database schema changes in a dynamic environment and deliver code to production by utilizing continuous integration and certain development techniques in minutes with minimal risk.

## Title: Big Data - The Biggest Fad of the Decade
 
**Abstract**:
In this session we will investigate what Big Data really means, and more importantly - what it doesn't mean. What makes Big Data different than any other data? What makes Big Data challenges different than the same old challenges we had 30 years ago? Together, we will perform an honest, inquisitive, and enlightening investigation of what Big Data really is, it's origins, and how it evolved over the last decade. We will use history, analytics and logic to dissect the beast, and expose it for what it really is. Why should you care? The Big Data hype is holding you back from doing what is really important with data - getting value out of it. Making sense of it. Vendors, organizations, and architects have become so obsessed with the 'Big Data' fad, and too many either lost sight, or no longer have the resources to pursue their real goals. In this session I will plea to your reasoning, critical thinking, and plain common sense, to wake up and shout with me "The Emperor has no cloths!!!"

## Title: Why Should I Care About ... Partitioned Views?
 
**Abstract**:
Partitioned tables are awesome and partitioned views are dead, right? Well, sure partitioned views are not sexy but there are still plenty of applications where they are critical. And not necessarily just for standard edition users who aren't on the new service pack yet. If your data is time stamped, do you see different queries run against older data than new data? Do you with you could segment your data across multiple columns? Do you have data you need to partition horizontally? It's possible partitioned views may still be for you. Come hear why this is still an important topic long after cargo pants and trucker hats went away ... and even after 2016 SP1.
