## Title: Extending DevOps To SQL Server
 
**Abstract**:
Most organizations are under pressure to speed up the software delivery cycle, whether that’s to respond more quickly to the needs of the business, the needs of your customers or just to keep up with the competition.  Unfortunately the database is commonly considered a bottleneck.  Without the right processes in place, database change management can slow things down, adding risk, uncertainty, and getting in the way of development and operations working together to deliver.  Any organization that wants to fully benefit from a DevOps approach is going to have to overcome some specific challenges presented by the database. This session will teach you how to take DevOps principles and practices and apply them to SQL Server so that you can speed up the database delivery cycle at the same time you protect the information contained within.

## Title: “Black Arts” Index Maintenance #1: How the “Best Practice” Methods are Silently Killing Performance
 
**Abstract**:
This isn’t your typical presentation on Index Maintenance.

In this 1st of two back-to-back sessions, we'll learn how the current “Best Practice” Methods are actually a leading cause of perpetual logical and physical fragmentation, totally unnecessary wasted memory/disk space, costly/continuous “Bad” page splits, unexplainable blocking, comparatively insane amounts of log file generation and, in an interesting “Catch 22”, a major part of why we have to do so much index maintenance and how it all negatively impacts your code even if it’s perfect code.

We'll also discover the true costs of page splits, how REORGANIZE can perpetuate them, their effect on performance, introduce and learn how to use "sp_IndexDNA" to see indexes as you've never seen them before, and introduce methods to make even active GUID-based indexes 100% fragmentation free for months at a time, which will also fix the problems we’ve discovered.

This 1st session is also a recommended segue into the second sessio

## Title: New features in Management Studio  -- Performance Troubleshooting made easier!
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is now updated each month with the latest version of the SQL Client Tools.  Which enabled rapid enhancement to Execution Plan.  

Do you know that you can now see how many pages are spilled to disk for a sort, as well as the memory statistics for the operator? Are you aware that you can see the top 10 waits for an execution and what trace flags were active during compilation and which ones influenced compilation? Have you ever analyzed a big plan and wish you could search for table name, index name or column name without opening XML plan? When you see a clustered index was used do you know for sure which statistics were used by the Query Optimizer to estimate the number of rows? 

In this demo intensive session, I will show you how to find and use new features introduced into SSMS and Showplan.  You will walk out of this session equipped to make Query Performance Troubleshooting easier and ready to tackle those nasty, hard to solve query plans.

## Title: Python in SQL Server 2017 and 2019
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2017 and 2019 have arrived, bringing with them a host of exciting new features.  Of particular interest to BI practitioners and data scientists is the integration of the Python programming language into the SQL ecosystem.  This integration opens up a number of possibilities for in-database analytics and intelligent database applications, so let's get started!

In this introductory session we'll briefly introduce the Python language and then look at how to install and administer Machine Learning Services.  We'll start to demonstrate the power of Python by showing you how to create and run simple scripts from within T-SQL.  We'll then discuss some of the powerful open source packages that are available to aid your data analyses.  Finally, we'll go through some examples of how to use Python to integrate data analytical methods in real-world situations, and wow your customers with the power of analytics!

## Title: Finding Islands, Gaps, and Clusters in Complex Data
 
**Abstract**:
Gaps and islands problems are often treated as academic problems that are discussed without relevant real-life problems to solve.

By subdividing a data set into meaningful groups of islands, we can perform analytics against it that would otherwise be slow, error-prone, or seemingly impossible!

Data clustering can be applied to complex data sets in order to answer questions about winning streaks, financial performance, monitoring/alerting, goal achievement, and more!

Data quality becomes critical when crunching data in this fashion. We address duplicate data, bad data, NULL, and any other unexpected weirdness that a user might throw at us.

This is a fast-paced session that delves into methods that can be applied to any data. A complete set of historical baseball records will be used as our imperfect sample data for everything from a player's hitting streak to the longest winning streak by a team on Wednesdays at night.

## Title: Continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) in Azure Data Factory
 
**Abstract**:
With Azure Data Factory (ADF) continuous integration, you help your team to collaborate and develop data transformation solutions within the same data factory workspace and maintain your combined development efforts in a central code repository. Continuous delivery helps to build and deploy your ADF solution for testing and release purposes. Basically, the CI/CD process helps to establish a good software development practice and aims to build a healthy relationship between development, quality assurance, and other supporting teams.

Let's explore how we can use Microsoft DevOps and GitHub to build and release our ADF pipelines to other environments.

## Title: Demystifying Data Compression
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server 2016 SP1 makes data compression available in all editions. Data compression can reduce storage costs, and provide a performance boost—and now compression is available without the added cost of Enterprise Edition. Whether you are a developer or a DBA, it's important to know how to use compression to save money and improve speed.

Come learn about how data compression actually works, the differences between ROW and PAGE compression, and learn how to pick the best compression level for your data. This session will cover the details of the compression algorithms, and the costs and benefits associated with each type of compression. 

By the end of this session, you'll have a better idea of how the different compression algorithms work, when compression is the right solution, as well as what type of compression to use.

## Title: Looking "Normal" and Seeing "Stars": Table Designs Working Together
 
**Abstract**:
Most database professionals know there are two different database design patterns - normal forms for OLTP databases and star schemas for data warehouses. We tend to discuss these separately. But these two designs actually work together when we create our table schemas.

In this session, we will review the basics of both normal forms and star schemas. We'll compare and contrast the two designs. We will then discuss how a normalized database design influences a star schema design and vice versa. 

By the end of the session, you will better understand how using the two designs together gives you a greater insight to how you use your data throughout its lifecycle.

## Title: Breaking the Social Code: How to be Socially Intelligent at Work
 
**Abstract**:
Is there a gap between your advanced technical skills and your social-emotional intelligence? Are you or your employees experiencing challenges communicating effectively with others, participating as part of a team, managing emotional reactions, or socially connecting at work? Is this impacting your ability to get promoted, retain employees, or establish positive workplace morale or relationships?  Do you want to increase your “likeability” factor for your professional growth and overall well-being? 

If you answered yes to any of these questions, then this session is for you! For many people, “social” does not come naturally and has to be explicitly taught. In this presentation, you will learn about the mindset that is required for developing new competencies, key cognitive skills needed for social success, and tools and strategies that you can use immediately with your team. This session is for people who have difficulty navigating the social world, as well as for their managers.

## Title: Will Query Store fix all my Performance Issues?
 
**Abstract**:
How many of you cross your fingers and hold your breath when a new upgrade or new code goes live in production? Well you can breathe now and relax your fingers because in SQL Server 2016 Microsoft released Query Store. Query Store is like a flight data recorder for SQL Server, the black box in an airplane captures everything that occurs on a flight. In this session we will deep dive to learn how to configure (yes – you need to configure this black box – or it could crash your “plane”), use Query Store to troubleshoot database performance issues. I will show you multiple demos to capture baseline, understand query regression and how to force good execution plan. You will walk away with the knowledge of how to configure and use Query Store to help fix performance issues.

## Title: SQL Injection: What Is It, Prevent It, Monitor For It!
 
**Abstract**:
This session will explain and demonstrate exactly how a SQL Injection attack occurs. While the core vulnerability is easy to understand, exactly how hackers exploit that vulnerability is not. I'll show you how a hacker explores your database through SQL Injection to find vulnerabilities and sensitive data. Better still, I'll show you the errors that this exploration generates, providing a mechanism for monitoring your systems to identify SQL Injection attacks. Finally, I'll show you the steps you should be taking to properly secure your systems in order to completely avoid SQL Injection attacks. SQL Injection is considered the primary vulnerability for most systems today. Learn how to protect yourself and your organization.

## Title: “Black Arts” Index Maintenance #2: Better Methods that Can Actual
 
**Abstract**:
This isn’t your typical presentation on Index Maintenance.

In this 2nd of two back-to-back sessions, we’ll learn the 5 main “Insertion Patterns” and how they cause or prevent fragmentation, introduce the additional page splitting/fragmenting horror of “ExpAnsive Updates”, continue to learn about the true costs of using REORGANIZE and why it should be avoided, how it all affects performance and disk/memory usage, how it all affects Index Maintenance, and steps that can be taken to seriously improve all of that. 

We'll also learn that simply reducing Fill Factors isn't the "fix" for fragmentation and can actually cost you serious amounts of additional totally wasted memory while providing little to no value.

Unfortunately, there won’t be time to cover it all but well documented code will be provided to help identify the sources of page splits and “ExpAnsive Updates” so that they can be eliminated.

Session #1 is a strongly recommend prerequisite for this session.
