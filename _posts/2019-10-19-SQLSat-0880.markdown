## Title: From Datawarehouse, across BI, to modern data analysis and artificial intelligence, Azure Databricks
 
**Abstract**:
Have you heard about Azure Databricks? The new kid in the Azure Big Data family? I would do wrong to call Azure Databricks as a managed Apache Spark service, as it is so much more.
In addition to transforming data, Databricks can also be used to analyze and stream data, run your ETL tasks, train Machine Learning models and explore your data. All of that can be done with the powerful compute engine, combined with an integrated development environment.
As a first-class citizen in Azure, Databricks is a Platform as a Service offering that makes Big Data accessible for everybody.

However, as always, the first steps are the hardest to take. Because of that, in this session, we have a look at how to provision Azure Databricks. You learn how to configure clusters, schedule jobs, stay secure and much more.

## Title: Fast like a Roadrunner - Get the M(eep) M(eep) into your M(eep)-Queries?
 
**Abstract**:
Mit Power BI kann man recht schnell komplexe M-Scripte zusammenklicken die das gewünschte Ergebnis liefern. Aber sind diese Scripte auch performant? Welche Einflussmöglichkeiten habe ich als BI Entwickler wenn ich mal wieder eine Folge Punisher auf Netflix gucken kann während Daten mit meiner M-Query geladen werden? Dieser spannenden Frage gehen der deutsche Data Platform MVP Frank Geisler und Dr. Benjamin Kettner in ihrem Vortrag nach. Neben grundsätzlichen Informationen zum Aufbau von M-Scripten in Power BI erfahren Sie, was Sie machen können um langsame M-Queries zu beschleunigen. Sie bekommen direkte Handlungsanweisungen an die Hand gegeben die Sie direkt in eigenen Umgebungen einsetzen können.

## Title: CI/CD for your Cloud Data Platform from Data Lake to Power BI
 
**Abstract**:
On the one hand, traditional Enterprise Data Warehouses are transforming into modern Data Platforms. On the other hand, onPremise systems are moving to PaaS services in the cloud.

These changes come with the challenge of an increasing number of components that have to be manged. However, they provide the benefit of the flexibility and scalability of PaaS services.

This presentation will demonstrate how to build a full modern data platform with CI/CD. Resources will be deployed as ARM templates, a Data Lake is configured and created, a database is deployed, in addition, Azure Analysis Services is configured and finally Power BI reports are deployed to Power BI workspaces. The platforms' glue are Azure Data Factory including the brand new ADF Mapping Flows and Azure Functions.

This enables to spin up a fully configured environment within minutes.

The presentation will demonstrate how to integrate all above technologies based on Azure DevOps.

## Title: Agile Data Warehousing
 
**Abstract**:
Changing requirements, obscure sources, surprising successes - are DWH projects ideal candidates for agile approaches? It's not that easy. No matter if on-prem or “modern” with big data and on Azure: Fixed price requirements, challenging stakeholder setups, missing test cases and often the sheer size of the action, point in a different direction. So, what should be "agile" in DWH projects? And what are the actual benefits?

After a brief reminder of what makes BI / DWH projects "different", we first look at a practice-proven agile approach (test and backlog-driven, etc.). Extra bonbon: Agile projects  fixed price.
Afterwards the reality check: What exactly qualifies this process as "Agile”? Are there hidden waterfalls? And which advantages or risks are we dealing with?
We close with discussing how to adapt this to your specific projects and the old debate SCRUM versus Kanban.

## Title: How to choose the right data model: SQL Server or Azure Cosmos DB. Which, When and Where ?
 
**Abstract**:
When it comes to choosing a database, always there are considerations about picking a relational (SQL) or non-relational (NoSQL) data structure. While both are viable options, there are certain key differences between these two options that users must keep in mind.This session will cover the most important distinctions and will make a difference between two of a key players in the Microsoft database world: SQL Server and Azure Cosmos DB.  The session will also illustrate some of the fundamental differences between these databases - the language, scalability and structure which cause this distinctions to have  implications for the right choice.So which database is right for your business the attendance will take informations in this session.

## Title: Four questions machine learning can answer
 
**Abstract**:
AI and machine learning are powerful tools! But as with all powerful tools you have to use them to solve the right problem: Even the most powerful hammer cannot do what a simple screwdriver can.

The aim of this talk is to help you identify business opportunities in which machine learning can help.
You will see four broad types of business problems for which machine learning can be the right tool for the job.

The next step will be to find answers to these questions. Azure provides many different ways to apply machine learning. In this session you will see demos of 4 different Azure services which can help you answer the questions: Cognitive services, ML Studio, SQL Server ML Services and Databricks.

## Title: From Power BI to AI – Enrich your BI with Artificial Intelligence
 
**Abstract**:
AI is everywhere – and now even included in Power BI. Sometimes AI might be very apparent when you enrich your data with predictions by explicitly calling an Azure Machine Learning web service in Power Query. Sometimes it might by hidden in a nice little context menu when Power BI is automagically explaining the reason of a difference or a change over time in your data to you.
No matter if you are a business user, analyst or data scientist – Power BI has AI capabilities tailored to you. In this session we will cover how you can integrate and leverage the use of language R, how to integrate an Azure Machine Learning Service when loading data, what kind of insights Power BI is capable of delivering automatically, how you can create a complex new column without typing a single formula/function, how you can explore your data by asking questions in plain English, ... and more!
Sounds like a lot of content? I omitted most of the slides in favour to spend the time in live demos instead.

## Title: Statistical Analysis with T-SQL
 
**Abstract**:
Transact-SQL language in latest editions of SQL Server has so many business intelligence (BI) improvements that it might become your primary analytic database system. You might even decide to use T-SQL for advanced analyses directly, without including R, Python, SSAS or Azure ML. However, to get the maximum out of these language constructs, you need to learn how to properly use them. This in-depth session shows extremely efficient statistical queries that use the window functions and are optimized through algorithms that use mathematical knowledge and creativity. During the session, the formulas and usage of those statistical procedures are explained as well. This session is useful not only for BI developers; database and other developers can successfully learn how to write efficient queries. Or maybe you want to become a data scientist? Then you need to know statistics and programming. You get the best of both in this session.

## Title: Power BI Dataflows? Why you need to implement it!
 
**Abstract**:
Not so long ago, Power BI Dataflows have been added to the Power BI landscape. It is showing great promise, as they have the potential of becoming key in every (large) implementation of a Power BI or Hybrid BI Architecture.

During this session, the core concepts of Power BI Dataflows will be explained, and we'll discuss how Power BI Dataflows could alleviate some of the specific problems you might be experiencing in your current architecture.

How this feature ties into some other cool concepts, like Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 or the Common Data Model, obviously can't be missing from this speech.

Expect to walk out of this session with a decent grasp on the underlying architecture, and some key takeaways to take home with you.

## Title: SQL Server high availability in cloud and hybrid environments
 
**Abstract**:
SIOS Sponsor Session: Many believe that enterprise applications running in the public cloud are guaranteed to have high availability. But no cloud service provider currently guarantees uptime at the application level. There are, of course, ways to assure high availability for critical applications running in private, public and hybrid cloud environments. But that responsibility lies with the enterprise, not with the cloud service provider.

This session, presented by SIOS Technology, will highlight important information business and IT staff need to know to provide both high availability (HA) and disaster recovery (DR) protections for critical applications – and specifically SQL Server – running in public and hybrid cloud environments, as well as on-premise!

## Title: Power BI Embedded with RLS Access to the on-prem Data Source
 
**Abstract**:
In this session, I invite you to join me on a hike from the on-premise data source to the full Power BI Embedded sample solution. After a steep and long climb, we reach the summit from where we can enjoy the prospect of a complete Power BI Embedded sample solution with the non-domain users getting a Power BI report provided with them with row-level security on an on-premise data source and all without programming skills.

We start with an overview of the requirements for our Power BI Embedded sample solution, then we go to the question: "What is Power BI Embedded?". Next, we focus on how all components of our sample solution interact and configure in detail, and then we publish a first Power BI Report. Next, we want to prove that row-level security works and implement a solution for continuous monitoring. 

This is a 1-hour session that is a compact version of the Precon that was scheduled for 18.10.2019.

## Title: ETL with Azure Databricks, The Complete Introduction
 
**Abstract**:
Azure Databricks seems to be the new sheriff in town. It promises easy but capable ETL (amongst other things). But how does it work? For an SSIS (and possibly BIML) person this all looks new and strange. Python notebooks? Scala? Spark? What is all this, and where do I start? Well, you start by coming to this presentation. We’ll take a look at how to approach making an Azure Databricks based ETL solution from start to finish. Along the way it will become clear how Azure Databricks works and we will use our SSIS based ETL knowledge to see if it can handle the common use-cases from our daily jobs. And of course we will also have some fun and see how fast it can go!

I've started with SQL Server 6.5 but only as a sys-admin and not as DBA. Later I'd worked as a full DBA with SQL Server 2000 and my love to SQL Server started. In 2015  I'd got more interested in SQL PASS and tried to speak for the first time... the main part of my job is to work as DB-Admin and solution architect but I'm trying to widen my horizons. In 2016 I've visited and volunteered at the German SQLSaturdays und SQLGrillen and since October 2016 I'm the organizer of Azure Meetup Hamburg.
