## Title: SQL Server 2017 Graph Database
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server has always provided tools to manage hierarchies and relationships, facilitating query execution on hierarchical data, but sometimes relationships can become complex. Think about many-to-many relationships, relational databases don't have a native solution for many-to-many associations. A common approach to realize a many-to-many association is to introduce a table that holds such relationship.​ SQL Server 2017, thanks to the Graph Database, can express certain kinds of queries more easily than a relational database by transforming complex relationships into graphs.​ In this session, I will introduce what Graph Database is and which scenarios it solves easily. The last demo will show how to build a recommendation system for sales offers that is able to determine the recommended products based on the product the customer is purchasing.

## Title: Boost your Tabular Productivity
 
**Abstract**:
Tabular Editor is an open source alternative that relies only on the Model.bim JSON metadata and the Tabular Object Model (TOM), thus providing an offline developer experience for Azure and on-premises tabular models. 

Making changes to measures, calculated columns, display folders, etc. is lightning fast, and the UI provides a "what-you-see-is-what-you-get" model tree allowing you to maintain Display Folders, Perspectives and Translations. The perfect tool for your tabular models.

Combined with scripting functionality, a Best Practice Analyzer, command-line build and deployment, and much more, Tabular Editor is a must for every SSAS Tabular developer. The tool is completely free.

Demoing the capabilities of the tool is what is in focus for this session and therefore do not expect many slides. Attendees are assumed to be familiar with Tabular Model development.

## Title: Magical Memory Moments
 
**Abstract**:
OR, How In-Memory Objects Can Supercharge Your Data And Bring About World Peace 

OK, so you’ve been reading about, perhaps even testing out some of the ‘in-memory’ objects now available in SQL Server. Some of the claims are exciting, and some seem overly optimistic. And Yet, you want to know, experience more … Perhaps your situation doesn’t really call out for in-memory tables. But you should consider memory-optimized #Temp tables, memory-optimized table variables, and natively compiled stored procedures.It’s true. Using memory-optimized tables requires a little more fore-thought, a bit more care, even a few configuration tweaks.
• But what are the real advantages of memory-optimized objects?
• What are the memory-optimized objects you can use?
• How can you best use memory-optimized objects?
In this demo packed session, we will discuss the pros and cons of using memory-optimized objects in ways that will supercharge your SQL Server.

## Title: Choosing the Right Database for Microservices Solutions
 
**Abstract**:
The past years have seen the explosive growth of large-scale distributed systems. This trend has changed the database world that is arguably without precedent in the history of the software industry. The result is a ompetitive database marketplace with a huge variety of platforms for us to choose from. But how do we go about making the right choices?

In this talk we will discuss how we can go about choosing the right database models for your application.  We will also look at how the choice of data models can help determine which technologies to include in your data tier.

## Title: A Masters view on Query plans and indexing
 
**Abstract**:
Do you find query optimization a mystery? This session will straighten out your question marks.
You will se how queries are run, how indexes are used and get an insight into what query plans tell you.
Further on you'll be introduced to In-Memory and Column Store indexing to get a fair chance of 
selecting appropriate indexing for your query load.

## Title: What can you do with SQL Server on Linux?
 
**Abstract**:
The best RDBMS meets the best Operating System. But can you leverage all the power of SQL Server on Linux? Can you create AlwaysOn Availability Groups on Linux? Can you use Integration Service (SSIS) to exchange data ? Is Change Data Capture (CDC) available? Can you use Active Directory Authentication? You will need to attend this session to get the answers!

## Title: Administrate SSRS/PBIRS with PowerShell
 
**Abstract**:
Once in a while I need to deploy dozens of reports, data sources, permissions and subscriptions across multiple Reporting Services folders. 
Some time ago, I accomplished this by hand, wasting hours of my life. Nowadays it takes me a couple of minutes and I'm done.

In this session I will share how you can leverage on ReportingServicesTools PowerShell module to deploy your reports, manage permissions and subscriptions and stop waste your time with some of those trivial tasks.

We will see examples for both Reporting Services and PowerBI Report Server.

## Title: Know What Your Code is Doing to SQL Server!
 
**Abstract**:
ORMs - oh how I LOVE them! As a consultant, when I see them in play at a client I go KACHIIINNNNGGGG!! :-D Seriously though, they can provide some substantial benefits for coding throughput. But if you don't Read The Fine Manual and do some things right and avoid some major gotchas you will fall prey to one of my favorite Guruisms: "Anything that allows developers to slap code together more quickly is inversely proportional to the performance and concurrency you will get from that code"! Although this talk is based on Entity Framework, most ORMs suffer from a lot of the same flaws.
