## Title: Tame Your Unruly Data...With Constraints!
 
**Abstract**:
Never given time or care, never forming good relationships, becoming bloated, corrupt and rife with indistinguishable copies, and all so horrifyingly pervasive in society. But enough about the Kardashians, what about YOUR DATA? If you want to straighten it out and prevent it from going too far in the first place, this session is for you. We will cover constraint basics (not null, check, primary key/unique, foreign keys), provide standard use cases, and address misconceptions about constraint use and performance. We will also look at triggers and application logic and why these are NOT substitutes for (but can effectively complement) good constraint usage. Attendees will enjoy learning how to keep THEIR data off the tabloid page!

## Title: De-Mystifying Query Plans: Focus on the Cardinality Estimator
 
**Abstract**:
The SQL Server optimizer is an engineering marvel.  The intelligence that is built into the product is mind bending.  But, sometimes queries don't run as expected.  Without a basic understanding of statistics and the cardinality estimator you'll never know why.

This session will walk through an anomaly of the cardinality estimator called The Ascending Key Problem.  A major focus of the discussion will include how the optimizer uses statistics to estimate row counts, which is ultimately used to build optimal query plans.

At the end of this session you will know how to assess the state of the statistics for your indexes and columns; you will know how to look at your query plans in a way that will help prevent poor query performance BEFORE the query executes; and you will better understand how the optimizer estimates row counts.

## Title: Getting Started with MDX
 
**Abstract**:
In this session, led by Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson, we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.   This session applies equally to Analysis Services 2008, 2008R2 and 2012.

## Title: Data Pages, Allocation Units, IAM chains... Oh My! - Storage Inte
 
**Abstract**:
Understanding how SQL Server organizes your data under the hood can seem like a daunting task. In this session we’ll take a look at how objects such as tables and indexes are stored in the data file. We’ll also look at how these concepts tie in to your work as a DBA or developer. We’ll see these concepts in action using demos and see how we can use this knowledge to better design solutions.

We’ll start off by looking at the structure of a row and then move on the concept of a data page. From there we’ll cover a few special page types like the index allocation map. Then we’ll look at index structures and talk about the differences between heaps and clustered indexes.

## Title: Getting Started with Analysis Services 2012 Tabular
 
**Abstract**:
The Analysis Services 2012 Business Intelligence Semantic Model (BISM) unifies Multidimensional (OLAP) and Tabular (relational) options for organizational BI.  In this session, BI Architect, SQL Server MVP and Analysis Services Maestro Bill Pearson introduces Microsoft Business Intelligence 2012 and the Business Intelligence Semantic Model ("BISM").  He then overviews the Tabular model, beginning with the creation of a project with SQL Server Data Tools (“SSDT”), and continuing from the data import steps to the creation and management of calculations, measures and Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”).  Finally, he provides insight to the creation and maintenance of perspectives and hierarchies, as well as other considerations involved in working with Tabular.

## Title: Table Vars and Temp Tables – What you NEED to Know!
 
**Abstract**:
Almost every SQL Developer is familiar with Table Variables and Temporary Tables. While each of these objects represents temporary storage, there are also substantial differences between them. Understanding the differences between Table Variables and Temporary Tables, and the ramifications that those differences cause, is essential to being able to properly select the appropriate object for use in your development tasks. In this code filled session, we’ll discover the differences and similarities of Temporary Tables and Table Variables, dispel some widespread myths about each, and answer the most important questions of them all, "When do I use one or the other and what are the various impacts of doing so?"

## Title: Converting Unreliable Deployments Into Consistent Releases
 
**Abstract**:
The deployment process is frustrating; an object is missing, an object is deployed in the wrong order or the incorrect version. Each database is made up of a lot of objects in different environments.  When you create an object like a table or stored procedure, you need to get this object deployed into each environment.  Together we will discover how to separate each object for proper order deployment while releasing only objects which have changed. Deployments can cause you trouble but we will provide a reliable deployment and version control process.

## Title: Tone Analysis with HDInsight and Azure Machine Learning
 
**Abstract**:
People’s sentiments and opinions are written in social networks. There are tweets, Facebook posts, book reviews, forum discussions, and more. These attitudes and feelings are communicated using text, with format depending on the social network. Twitter messages are limited to 140 characters and use hash-tags,; Facebook messages can be longer. This session reviews the different Natural Language Processing, text mining, and data mining techniques you can use for sentiment and tone analysis. Organizations can use the extracted knowledge for brand reputation, market predictions, and automatic learning. We’ll look at, Hadoop, data mining, Microsoft Big Data Hadoop distribution HDInsight and Azure Machine Learning

## Title: Designing an SSIS Framework in 2015
 
**Abstract**:
Enterprise data integration changed with the introduction of the SSIS Catalog. Implementing enterprise data integration often requires functionality beyond the rich features provided by the SSIS Catalog. Building on his previous work in the field of Data Integration Life Cycle Management (DILM) and SSIS Frameworks development, a Data Integration Architect with 10 years of SSIS experience explains the what, why, and how of an SSIS Catalog-integrated Framework that delivers metadata-driven package execution, connections management, and parameter configuration.

In this session, you will learn: 
-	A method for migrating packages from Development, through the data integration life cycle, to Production without editing SSIS Connection Manager Properties.
-	A metadata-driven approach to SSIS package execution.
-	A method for customizing enterprise data integration reporting.

## Title: Advanced Scripting Using SSIS Script Tasks and Components
 
**Abstract**:
SSIS has many great built-in tasks and components. Sometime, though, you need to go further than what they allow. Come to this session to see how far you can stretch the scripting capabilities of SSIS. 
SSIS offers significant capabilities out-of-the-box. However, many data movement projects have needs that go above and beyond the common scenarios. Have you ever needed to calculate running totals during your ETL process? What about using dynamically updated business rules during processing to determine what data is valid? These things, and much more, can be accomplished using the script task and component within SSIS. During this session, we will demonstrate several scripts in SSIS (including the ones mentioned above) that show how to take full advantage of the capabilities of SSIS. This session is intended for people who have worked with and understand SSIS, and have a basic understanding of .NET development.

## Title: Closing the SSIS Package Management Story with BIPS
 
**Abstract**:
Existing SSIS automation solutions are focused on forward-motion activities: creating packages and pushing them to the server.  Little or no thought is given to the management of the packages once they are in production - existing tooling offers nothing to help you understand and manage a live, money-printing ETL workflow based on SSIS packages.

BIPS is an open source project that allows you to manage a live SSIS package tree from PowerShell.  It closes the automation loop, providing the ability to learn and discover the features of an existing package deployment tree as well as manipulate it.  In short, the goal of BIPS brings a devops perspective to managing your SSIS packages.

In this session, you will learn how to leverage BIPS in your own environment.  Specific attention will be given to searching and filtering tasks and data flows on arbitrary criteria and manipulating specific parts of the ETL workflow from the shell.

## Title: Testing Data and Data-Centric Applications
 
**Abstract**:
Testing applications that depend on data can be hard. Everyone agrees that testing is vital, but knowing what to test and how to test it is challenging. Come to this session for a methodology for testing your data, and the applications that use it.
Testing is vital to fast, successful delivery of software and information today. While application testing is generally well understood, data centric testing is not. The success of many applications depends on them producing valid, correct data, yet this is often tested as an afterthought, or not tested at all. During this session, we will discuss how to test the data produced by applications or data movement processes. We’ll cover how to determine the accuracy and quality of your data, and how to incorporate the testing into your data lifecycle. The focus will be on what you need to test, and the techniques for validating that the data produced is accurate.
