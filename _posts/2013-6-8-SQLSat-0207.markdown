## Title: Reporting Services for Mere DBAs

As a DBA in the modern era, you may be required from time to time to do something outside of your comfort zone.  One of these things may be to become quickly acquainted with SSRS.  Even better is that you may be required to do things you have not considered in a standard report.  In this session, you will learn how to implement a framework to help provide a common ground for your reports.  This session will delve into fun topics such as dynamic grouping and dynamic sorting.  We are not talking about the interactive sorting that your accountant may use.  Attendees will also be introduced to a few quick methods of exporting Reports from the report server - this is from a DBA perspective after-all!
