## Title: SQL Server 2014 for Hybrid Cloud 
 
**Abstract**:
The cloud is here and Hybrid cloud can help you get started and move forward! Cloud computing brings a new paradigm shift in computing and organizations continue to realize the potential cost benefits of running their database applications in the cloud with greater scale and flexibility.  Take almost any application scenario, from the largest public websites to small departmental applications, and you will find the vast majority of organizations look to take advantage of cloud computing, the availability of cloud-enabled database systems will be critical to their success. This session looks at the Microsoft vision of relational database management systems in the context of cloud computing. It is a hybrid IT vision that gains leverage from the industry-standard Microsoft SQL Server technology set and makes it available across the spectrum of deployment approaches organizations can take today.

## Title: SQL Server Security 101
 
**Abstract**:
SQL Server security sound simple.  We grant permissions to people and processes that need access to our SQL Server instances and databases, while controlling which data they can access and what actions they can perform.
    However, behind this simple statement lies much complexity.  In practice, it is easy for the novice database administrator to get lost in the hierarchy of principals, securables and permissions that comprise the SQL Server security architecture.  The most common result is the path of least resistance, where people end up with "too many privileges."  
    My primary goals are to provide a simple, concise description of how the SQL Server permission hierarchy works, and then demonstrate, step by step, how to implement the "Principle of Least Privilege" in securing SQL Server.  
    I will also mention security-related items that are new to SQL Server 2014.

## Title: Mission Possible: Interactive Performance Troubleshooting - Indexes
 
**Abstract**:
Performance troubleshooting is detective work. We'll have a lab system being assaulted by PowerShell scripts  (to simulate live users), and simulated performance problems like those that can make your on-call cell phone ring too much! Do you think you have what it takes to find these "needle in the haystack" issues and resolve them quickly?  This will be a highly interactive session where we will locate the rogue queries together, work through solutions, implement them and measure the results.  In this episode we'll focus primarily on improper indexing as a common underlying problem and all will walk away with much better troubleshooting skills and an upgraded knowledge of performance tuning!

## Title: Creating SSRS Reports Efficiently Through Best Practices
 
**Abstract**:
You always have more report requests than you can possibly fulfill. Wouldn’t it be great if you could speed up the generation of reports? Templates can streamline the life cycle of a report for the whole team. In this session, you’ll learn how templates in your tool belt can help you efficiently gather requirements, quickly design mock-ups, and standardize the look and feel of your SSRS reports. 
Reports don’t stop changing once they’re released into production, and some reports are phased out over time. Wouldn’t it be great to have a way to keep track of the changes a report takes on in production over time? We’ll talk about how to keep track of change requests, how to analyze the utilization of existing reports, and how to track changes in users for the reports in production.

## Title: Defeating the Limitations of the Query Optimizer
 
**Abstract**:
Query optimizers are highly complex pieces of software, which even after 40 years of research, still face several technical challenges in some fundamental areas. As a result, there may be cases when even after you've provided the query optimizer with all the information it needs, you still don’t get an efficient execution plan for your queries. This session will show you the current challenges and limitations of query optimizers in general and the SQL Server query optimizer in particular, along with solutions or workarounds to avoid each of these problems.

## Title: Understanding Parameter Sniffing
 
**Abstract**:
Parameter sniffing is a good thing: it is used by the Query Optimizer to produce an execution plan tailored to the current parameters of a query. However, due to the way that the plan cache stores these plans in memory, sometimes can also be a performance problem. This session will show you how parameter sniffing works and in which cases could be a problem. How to diagnose and troubleshoot parameter sniffing problems and their solutions will be discussed as well. The session will also include details on how the Query Optimizer uses the histogram and density components of the statistics object and some other advanced topics.

## Title: Testing with SSIS
 
**Abstract**:
Often times, a database developer needs to test the data under different scenarios.  There are many ways to do that, and some of them involve using TFS and other expensive tools. However, the often-overlooked way to create unit tests and even to automate the data lifecycle is always under the DB developer's finger tips and involves using SSIS and jobs agent for the test automation. The session will provide live hands on examples.

## Title: Converting Unreliable Deployments Into Consistent Releases
 
**Abstract**:
The deployment process is frustrating; an object is missing, an object is 
deployed in the wrong order or the incorrect version. Each database is 
made up of a lot of objects in different environments. When you create an 
object like a table or stored procedure, you need to get this object deployed 
into each environment. Together we will discover how to separate each 
object for proper order deployment while releasing only objects which have 
changed. Deployments can cause you trouble but we will provide a reliable 
deployment and version control process.

## Title: Changing Your Habits to Improve the Performance of Your T-SQL
 
**Abstract**:
Do you dread handing your T-SQL over for code review? Do your queries run slower than you expect? Does the DBA always want to tweak your T-SQL? In this demo heavy session, we’ll take a look at various ways to improve your T-SQL. You’ll learn about formatting T-SQL for readability and why top down design is not the best solution for writing T-SQL. You’ll learn why implicit conversions slow queries down and how to leverage simple techniques for minimizing the performance impact of explicit conversions. By changing some of your T-SQL writing habits you can improve performance of queries from the very beginning.

## Title: Manageable SSAS Deployment Strategies
 
**Abstract**:
When it comes to making changes to your production Analysis Services databases, do you simply open the SSAS DB in SQL Server Data Tools (or BIDS) and click through creating the changes? Does this method lead to problems keeping everything in sync and the right changes deployed to the right environment at the right time? Have you, the BI developer, had to fight to get Production access to do your own deployments?

If you've answered "yes" to any of these questions, and are in search of a better way, I have the solution! In this demo-heavy session, we will look at five steps to more robust, controllable, and flexible Tabular and Multidimensional SSAS deployments.

## Title: Trimming Indexes Getting Your Database In Shape
 
**Abstract**:
Indexes are a wonderful thing.  We should be using them, and we should be maintaining them.  But over time our production databases start to look a little pudgy around the mid-section.  Maybe they are a little bloated with Unused Indexes, maybe they have Duplicate Indexes, and possibly even Reverse Indexes.  The first step to fixing these problems it so see if you have them, and if you do the second is to set about fixing them. You could be costing yourself CPU cycles, I/Op’s, and space and never even know it.

## Title: Storage For the DBA
 
**Abstract**:
One of the biggest issues in database performance centers around storage.  It’s also one of the hardest places to troubleshoot performance issues because storage engineers and database administrators often do not speak the same language.  In this session, we’ll be looking at storage from both the database and storage perspectives.   We’ll be digging into LUNs, HBAs, the fabric, as well as RAID Groups.  In addition to theory, we’ll be looking at an actual EMC SAN so that we can translate what we see in the Storage Array with what we see on the actual server.

## Title: AlwaysOn - Finally, A usable 'mirror'!
 
**Abstract**:
In the past, High Availability and Disaster Recovery (HADR) had many limitations. Clustering and Mirroring are great, but the mirror/secondary database is not very usable since it is not online.  Finally, AlwaysOn solves this limitation by merging both multi-node Clustering and mirroring. AlwaysOn also allows the secondary database to remain ONLINE, so we can use it for reporting purposes without resorting to a Snapshot!  Come see this lively session with extensive demos of setting up, configuring and testing AlwaysOn. We'll also test automatic fail-over using a real web app to see how well this feature works.
